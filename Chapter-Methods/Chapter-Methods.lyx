Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using adhesive tape to exfoliate van der Waals crystal spearheaded a boom
 in 2D material research.
 2D crystals are typically prepared in one of two methods: films grown on
 premanufactured substrates or exfoliated flakes from van der Waals crystals.
 Films are sought for material commercialization as they can be incorporated
 into large-scale manufacturing processes.
 Industrial scale process require a lot of time to development to insure
 the film can be grown uniformity, using a reliable process that scales
 and is cost effective.
 Exfoliated crystals are typically used in initial material development
 and characterization as they are often easier to produce and faster to
 work with on small scale initial devices.
 By growing a bulk crystal, the parameters of the substrate lattice are
 removed from the crystal growth, reducing many complications seen in film
 development.
 Due their self-contained nature, flakes can be easier to physically manipulate
 when developing a new process as they are not bonded to a substrate.
 Flakes may additionally be stacked in layered hetrostructures to create
 devises with more unique properties, and can display new phenomina such
 as interface effects between the layers.
 Advances in flake devices often drive development of film growth to incorporate
 the 2D crystal properties into commercial devices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both flake and film device fabrication follow similar processes to add wires
 or pattern the crystal by etching.
 Figure

\end_inset

 shows an example of the two different processes while the details of each
 are given in the respective sections below.
 For most films and some flakes any unwanted material must first be removed
 to reduce the crystal down to the desired size and shape.
 The substrate is first covered with a protective polymer resist that forms
 a uniform coating over the entire surface.
 The polymer is patterned using photo or electron-beam lithography process
 to leave only the desired material covered.
 The excess crystal is then removed using an etching process, this can be
 using something like a gas-plasma or a wet process with a chemical that
 reacts with the crystal, such as a strong acid.
 The chemical etch can often destroy the protective layer or begin to eat
 through the exposed sides, so the duration and method of the etch must
 be considered.
 The polymer is then removed with solvents so only the patterned crystal
 remains on the substrate.
 For adding wires to the the crystal, substrate is (again) covered with
 a protective polymer and patterned, exposing the surfaces to be covered
 by metal contacts.
 Typically the wires will cover a portion of the crystal top and a small
 sidewall, then extend into other parts of the substrate to connect to other
 crystals or expose the wires.
 Metal is evaporated, sputtered, or otherwise deposited onto the surface
 to adhere to the exposed surfaces of the crystal and substrate.
 The polymer is dissolved, taking with it the excess metal deposited on
 the polymer, and leaving only desired metal leads.
 This process can be repeated after additional crystals are added, allowing
 us to create complex devices with layered crystals, each with their own
 contacts.

For fabricating flake devices we chose a wafer platform to work that gave
 us a near-optimal optical contrast

\end_inset

 and then added markers for reference locations and align lithography patterns
 to.
 We started with 4 inch wafers of 
\begin_inset Formula $500\mu m$
\end_inset

 phosphorus doped silicon with 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $300nm$
\end_inset


\series default
 of thermally oxidized 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 as a substrate (<100> thermal oxide, purchased from Si-Tech) with a mechanicall
y polished surface.
 The doped silicon allows us to use the bulk of the silicon as a conductive
 gate, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $300nm$
\end_inset

 oxide would give a high contrast for most 2D materials under white light.
 The substrate was cleaned for better adhesion of photoresist polymer.
 To remove the protective resist added before shipping the wafer is sonicated
 in acetone for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes in 2-isopropanol remove
 acetone residue, and finally dried using compressed nitrogen gas.
 Using standard photolithography (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:LOR+SPR"

\end_inset

) we patterned the surface with a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5nm$
\end_inset

 thin layer of titanium for adhesion, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim35nm$
\end_inset

 of gold.
 The metals were laid out with a repeating pattern of numbers and lines,
 allowing us to record substrate location and easily find a flake on the
 substrate when moving between tools, figure

a.
 We spun a protective layer of PMMA resist over the substrate then diced
 the wafer into 
\begin_inset Formula $8mm$
\end_inset

 square chips with a ADT 7100 ProVectus Dicing Saw.
 This allowed us to make many devices per wafer in one quick process, each
 chip could then be arranged in a custom orientation and pattern for each
 flake-device.
 The resist was then removed from the chips using acetone, 2-isoproponal,
 and deionized (DI) water then dried with compressed nitrogen.
 To remove any residue organics we soaked the chips in Nano-Strip (a sulfuric
 acid and hydrogen peroxide compound, VWR) for 10 minutes, rinsed in DI-water,
 then repeated the initial solvent clean.
 After several devices experienced dialectic breakdown across the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 we switched the residue clean to an oxygen surface treatment for some devices.
 This was done in a M4L Plasma Processing System with 300 sccm oxygen, 100
 sccm helium, at 500mTorr of pressure, and 100W power for 1 minute.

\begin_layout Subsection
Mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Mechanical-flake-exfoliation"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flakes of van der Waals materials were mechanically exfoliated using Scotch
 3M Transparent Tape to break the weaker bond between layers.
 A piece of tape was pressed into a larger bulk crystal of the material
 then peeled off, resulting in a few smaller, dispersed crystals.
 To further cut down on crystal size and increase the surface density the
 tape is then folded over itself so the crystals are pressed into different
 areas of tape, ideally without coming into contact with each other and
 increasing the flake density.
 The tape was then peeled apart so that the crystals break additional van
 der Waals bonds and form thinner layered crystals.
 This process was repeated several times to provide a region of crystal
 coverage roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10mm$
\end_inset

 in diameter, to match the size of the alignment mark substrate.
 This region of tape is then pressed into a fresh region of tape, providing
 a new exposed surface of crystals with less tape residue and further decreasing
 the flake thickness.
 This can be repeated to thin the layers of crystal but must be balanced
 against decreasing tape coverage.
 The thickness of some materials, such as graphene, can be estimated by
 their reflectivity on the tape, giving a rough guess of how many times
 the folding process should be repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tape and crystals are then placed on a cleaned aliment marker chip,
 ideally maximizing the amount of crystals within the center of the chip,
 as flakes near the edges can be hard to work with during the lithography
 and wiring steps.
 The tape is lightly pressed into the chip with a soft tool so that as much
 of the crystals as possible are in contact with the surface of the chip.
 This can cause the flakes to crack so a balance in tool pressure and pattern
 must be used, and this must be calibrated to the crystal hardness and ease
 of layer separation.
 To promote adhesion to the surface, the chip can then be heated for 1-2
 minutes at 
\begin_inset Formula $100C$
\end_inset

 to improve adhesion to the substrate.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "huang2015reliable"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 The chips are then allowed to cool and the tape peeled off, leaving a freshly
 cleaved surface on both the substrate and top of the flakes.
 The angle and speed of the tape removal may influence the number and quality
 of flakes on the substrate, but there is very little control of either
 when done by hand.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After exfoliation we scanned each chip for flakes using a Nikon Eclipse
 LV150 microscope with 10x, 50x and 100x objectives.
 We chose

.
 Flakes are chosen for uniformity (lacking in visible cracks or damage that
 would impact electronic measurements), thinness, and lateral sizes large
 enough for photolithography processing.
 Flake thickness is very hard to judge using an optical measurement and
 depends on the material used, the lighting, and substrate chosen.
 To create a rough estimation of thickness we fabricate a color code for
 new materials while fixing as many microscope parameters as possible.
 A Bruker Icon Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is used to measure flake height
 and later compared against the optical pictures.
 Below 30nm most of the flakes of various materials became translucent rather
 than changing color, increasing the difficulty of finding flakes and using
 optical measurements to estimate flake thickness.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For many of the measurements we sought flakes under 
\begin_inset Formula $10nm$
\end_inset

 down to a single layer as they may display properties not shown in bulk
 crystals.
 Care must be taken to distinguish flakes from tape residue which will often
 appear very similar to thin flakes in color.
 Flakes may often be distinguished by sharp edges as many 2D materials tend
 to tear along straight lines, though tape residue can mimic this by adhering
 to flakes on the tape, then sticking to substrate while the flake remains
 on the tape.
 After identification of useful flakes, images were taken using a Nikon
 Ds-Fi1 camera with increased exposure times using the 100x objective and
 10x to record the flake conditions before fabrication and its location
 relative to markers.

\begin_layout Subsection
Photolithography 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Photolithography is a common technique used by industry and academia alike,
 used to pattern electronics at sizes far below what can be easily done
 with mechanical manipulations.
 In most variants of photolithography, a series of photosensitive polymers,
 or resists, are spread over a surface then exposing the polymer to light
 to change the chemical makeup of the polymer.
 This can be done by spinning a solution of the desired polymer, made with
 a compatible solvent, at high speeds over a substrate.
 The solution is dripped on the substrate either statically or dynamically
 under a slower rotation.
 The substrate is then rotated at high speeds until the desired thickness
 of polymer is left on the surface, the excess being spun off the substrate
 edges.
 The solvent is the partially removed by baking the substrate and polymer
 for a short time so the resist reaches a consistent durability.
 The resist is then exposed to light or an electron beam that causes the
 polymer to react.
 in After exposure the undesired resist is then removed by soaking the substrate
 in a chemical developer.
 Developer selection must take into account any chemistry between the developer
 and working materials as some developers can react with the exposed material.
 For negative resists, exposed regions of polymer are removed when developed,
 positive resists will only have non-exposed regions removed.
 For devices that change based on the flake, the resist pattern is generated
 on a computer and then written by a moving laser to fit the device dimensions.
 In commonly used patterns, a mask of chrome on quartz is prefabricated.
 The mask is moved over the flake then the entire surface is flooded with
 light at once, exposing the regions with the desired resist pattern.
 We typically choose a multiple layer resist stack as allowing the bottom
 layer dissolve long enough to undercut the top allows for easier liftoff
 when removing evaporated metals (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Metal-evaporation-liftoff"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Resist can also be used to protect part of a sample when etching allowing
 a patterned etch of the substrate or testing device.

The LOR/SPR negative resist stack is easy to use and allows for high resolution

 Before any resist is added the substrate is given a dehydration bake of

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $60s$
\end_inset

 to remove any water.
 A layer of LOR-2A is statically deposited as the first layer of the stack.
 The substrate is then spun at 
\begin_inset Formula $4000RPM$

 so we developed an alternate photolithography resist stack with a solvent
 used to develop the layer closest to the material.
 First a layer of Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA-2A) (Microchem) is statically

 for

\end_inset

 for

 to reduce the thickness to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim300nm$

, and baked at 
\begin_inset Formula $180C$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $60s$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Finally, a top-coat of SPR-3012 is dynamically dispensed at 900RPM.
 This is then spun at 
\begin_inset Formula $4000RPM$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $45s$
\end_inset

 for a thickness 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1.3\mu m$
\end_inset

 and baked for 
\begin_inset Formula $95C$
\end_inset

 for 60s.
 The SPR-3012 is then exposed using a MA/BA Contact aligner with 54mW of
 light (peak 
\begin_inset Formula $365nm$
\end_inset

), developed for 
\begin_inset Formula $60s$
\end_inset

 in in Microposit CD-26 from Shipley (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:LOR+SPR"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), then rinsed in water.
 The PMMA and SF6 under-layers are exposed for 30 minutes in a Deep UV (peak
 
\begin_inset Formula $270nm$
\end_inset

, OAI Deep UV Flood Exposure) at 5.3mW (~9.5 J).
 The SF6 is developed in 101A developer (Microchem) for 
\begin_inset Formula $90s$
\end_inset

 then rinsed in water.
 Finally, the PMMA is developed for 10 minutes in methyl isobutyl ketone
 (MIBK) and a trace amount of water.
 The substrate is moved though the water for 
\begin_inset Formula $5-10s$
\end_inset

 then to the MIBK, where a thin bubble of water continues to adhere to the
 resist near the exposed region.
 After allowing the water to sit on the sample for another 
\begin_inset Formula $10-30s$
\end_inset

, the substrate is gently shaken back and forth with tweeters to dislodge
 the SPR layer from the top of the sample.
 This prevents the SPR from later partially peeling up then adhering to
 the substrate, ruining the lithography pattern.
 The sample is left in the MIBK for another 
\begin_inset Formula $5-10m$
\end_inset

 to develop the PMMA down to the substrate.
 The MIBK is then removed with 2-proponal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternate version of this process used a thicker PMMA (6A) with SPR-3012
 on top.
 Because the SPR uses a PMMA-compatible solvent (Cyclopentanone) the two
 layers would intermix and form a layer that was unable to be dissolved
 in either developer.
 This was removed by ashing the layer for 515 seconds in the M4L with 250
 sccm oxygen, 50 sccm helium, 500mTorr pressure, 450W power.
 This process varied greatly depending on polymer uniformity and location
 of device on the substrate so later devices included the PMGI SF6 layer
 to eliminate the inconsistency.

Thin filament shadow mask
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an alternative to lithography, we used an all-dry quartz filament shadow
 mask for metal evaporation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Metal-evaporation-liftoff"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This allowed us to test contact resistance of an underlying material without
 introducing the polymers, chemicals, and processing to the material that
 may damage the surface or leave a residue between the material and metal
 contacts.
 We heated two quartz rod ends with an acetylene torch until semi-molten.
 We then lightly touched the two ends together and quickly pulled the ends
 apart within the flame.
 If done correctly, this produced several 
\begin_inset Formula $2-10cm$
\end_inset

 long strands of quartz that were 
\begin_inset Formula $<2\mu m$
\end_inset

 in diameter.
 These were identified under a florescent light by their thread-like behavior,
 losing most stiffness and free to float in the air when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lesssim2\mu m$
\end_inset

 in diameter.
 These filaments were then caught on glass forks by dragging the filament
 across the opening and snapping the end attached to the quartz rod.
 The forks were cut to fit over the sides of our sample chip substrates
 and reinforced with metal for durability.
 The sample chip was attached to a glass slide with double-sided tape.
 These filaments were then draped over the sample material with the glass
 fork.
 The ends of the filament were then cut with a tungsten needle and the glass
 fork removed.
 The filament could be adjusted by pulling it gently with a thin copper
 wire until it was in place and laying flat against the surface.
 This often caused the quartz to snap so the range of movement was limited
 to within a few 10s of microns from where it started.
 Once the filament was maneuvered it was fixed in place by wrapping the
 ends in Teflon tape that wrapped around the glass slide.
 Teflon tape was chosen as it is unlikely to scratch the material and has
 no adhesive that would cause the filament to move when securing it.
 The tape was also used to reduce the exposed area so only a small region
 around the material was included and reduce the risk of a short between
 the two sides.
 We found a filament less than 
\begin_inset Formula $.5\mu$
\end_inset

 tended to cause a short between the two sides while greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $3\mu m$
\end_inset

 would not sit flush against the surface.
 Metal choice is similarly important as certain metals like indium tended
 to

 across the surface and short at any diameter.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metal deposition was done using the Lab-18 Thin Film Deposition System (Kurt
 J.
 Lesker Co.).
 This was used to add contacts to a lithography-patterned flake by covering
 a substrate with layers of metal.
 We used electron beam evaporated titanium and gold for the uniform deposition
 and high conductivity.
 First 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5nm$
\end_inset

 of titanium was deposited at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1\mathring{A}/s$
\end_inset

 as titanium adheres well to 
\begin_inset Formula $SiO_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Next a layer of 
\begin_inset Formula $35-50nm$
\end_inset

 of gold was evaporated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1\mathring{A}/s$
\end_inset

 on top of the titanium.
 The gold provided a highly conductive protective layer that was inert in
 atmosphere and safe to use when wiring samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lab-18 Thin Film Deposition System also had an in situ ion source that
 could be used to clean and roughen the surface of a material before deposition
 occurred.
 A typical process used 
\begin_inset Formula $10sccm$
\end_inset

 of argon gas flowed over a metal coil with 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5A$
\end_inset

 of emission current and 
\begin_inset Formula $150V$
\end_inset

 between the coil and the substrate.
 The ion source is undirected which caused trace amounts of iron from the
 chamber itself to be knocked loose and deposited on the surface of the
 sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To remove excess metals from the substrate the lithography resist was then
 removed though a `liftoff' process.
 The resist stacks were designed to have a small undercut between the top
 and bottom layer to allow solvents to dissolve the resists from the edges
 even if metal had deposited on the sides of the upper layers.
 For LOR-based (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:LOR+SPR"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) stacks the substrate was soaked in heated Remover-PG (Microchem) for 10
 minutes at 
\begin_inset Formula $60C$
\end_inset

.
 The Remover-PG was then gently blown with a pipette over the surface of
 the substrate to push away any metals that were no longer adhered to resist.
 This process was repeated until all of the resist and metal adhered to
 it were removed.
 As smaller features had less surface area of resist for the solvent to
 resolve, more forceful streams were sometimes needed.
 If this was not enough to peel off the resist, sonication in a water bath
 was sometimes used.
 This often pulled off the metals deposited on the substrate, flake, or
 even the flake itself, so was used only when necessary.
 The Remover-PG was then removed by soaking the material in 2-proponal for
 5 minutes and blow-dried with a nitrogen gun.
 For PMMA based stacked unheated acetone was used in the place of Remover-PG
 while the rest of the process was the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sample wiring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample flake and film crystals were typically a few tens of microns across
 wile wires used in any electronics are far larger.
 Our wiring process allowed for us to make connections first to a sample
 mount with fixed wiring attachments, the mount could then be attached to
 larger devices without removing the wires from the sample or risk damaging
 the materials.
 Lithography wiring patterns were designed with 
\begin_inset Formula $.5-1mm$
\end_inset

, per side, square pads that connected by metal leads running along the
 substrate to the sample material.
 To connect the pads to a pre-existing wiring system we used a series of
 indium dots and thin gold wires (99.95% Au, 
\begin_inset Formula $25\mu m$
\end_inset

; Alfa Aesar).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first adhered the gold wire to the wiring structure with lead-free solder,
 this avoided any currents from the soldering iron from damaging the sample.
 Next we placed an indium dot (99.99% In, 0.20mm diameter,; Indium Corporation)
 on each of the sample wiring pads using modified tweezers.
 The tweezers were cut down to a single prong, then the tip cut flat at
 a 45 degree angle and further sanded smooth using the side of a razor blade.
 This allowed the indium dot to adhere to the tip easily.
 The modified tweezers can be held similar to a pen for increased dexterity
 and use with samples in recessed mounts, and greatly increase ease of wiring
 and speed.
 The gold wire was then bent down and pressed into the indium dot on the
 wiring pad, so the dot was only slightly flattened and the wire remained
 fastened.
 A second indium dot was pressed into the first, forming a sandwich-like
 structure, that held the gold wire firmly in place.
 The excess gold wire was then bent away from the sample along the original
 wire to prevent it from coming into contact with any part of the sample
 or other wires.
 This process was repeated for each of the wiring pads on the device.

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent static discharge from damaging the material devices several measures
 were taken.
 A ionizing fan (Chapman VSE3000 static eliminator) was constantly blown
 across the sample and wiring station at all times to discharge any static
 build up.
 The person doing the wiring was grounded with a static wrist strap to the
 building ground at all times when touching the device.
 The modified tweezers were held without gloves to connect it to the building
 ground though the body.
 The wiring station used a rubber floor mat with metal stool to isolate
 the person from the floor and prevent any charge buildup from the ground.
 Finally, clothing was chosen to reduce the buildup of static, especially
 in winter as the dryer air made hazardous amounts of static buildup fairly
 frequent.

\begin_layout Standard
Layer Transfer is a method to create complex heterostructures of 2D materials,
 typically flakes, by vertically stacking multiple crystals.
 Stacked heterostructures can take advantage of the distinct properties
 of each material without the lower layers altering the growth of subsequent
 compounds, as in other methods.
 We began by fabricating thin stamps of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), a clear
 resin that is commonly used for layer transfers.
 The PDMS stamps are formed using a mix of Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer
 and curing agent in a 12:1 ratio in a flat plastic or petri dish to form
 an ~1mm thin film.
 The mix is stirred for 3 minutes to distribute the agent, then sonicated
 for 4 minutes on low power to remove most bubbles, and finally any remaining
 bubbles in the mixture are popped by hand using a thin needle or rod.
 The PDMS is then left to cure for about 12 hours, covered to avoid any
 particle contamination.
 The resulting film can be diced to any desired size, then picked up and
 applied to glass slides or other flat platforms for use.
 Care must be taken to choose a dish with a very flat bottom and the mixture
 is allowed to cure levelly, otherwise the surface of film will move out
 of microscope focus under horizontal translation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We started by exfoliating flakes of crystal directly on to PDMS stamps and
 identifying the flakes under the optical microscope, similar to what would
 be done on a typical substrate.
 Once the desired flake on PDMS is identified it can be transferred directly
 onto the desired substrate.
 This process has the advantage of using the fewest steps and compounds
 to do the transfer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "frisenda2018recent"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 with the trade-off that flakes less than 10 nm are hard to identify on
 the clear resin.
 The glass slide is affixed to a mount with the PDMS stamp on the bottom
 side.
 The mount is then connected to a manual micro precision linear stage capable
 in moving in any direction.
 This setup is show in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The target substrate is placed on a heating block directly under the stamp
 and affixed with double-sided tape to prevent it adhering to stamp after
 contact.
 The flake and target are separately moved to the center of the microscope
 field of view then aligned with each other.
 This was typically done by drawing the outline of the substrate target
 on monitor with marker and moving the flake to match.
 The stamp is then lowered into contact with the substrate, taking into
 account any lateral stamp-to-substrate shifting from the contact.
 Once the flake is in contact with the desired part of the substrate, the
 underlying heating block is set to 80 C causing the PDMS to soften and
 lower adhesion.
 While heated, the flake-substrate van der Waals bond should be stronger
 than the PDMS-flake bond, so the slide can be removed while the flake adheres
 to the target.
 As an alternative to the glass slide, we also used a metal slide with an
 optical window cut into the center for the PDMS to hang from if the stamp
 was not flat.
 The center of the stamp hung below the edges so the flake would always
 be able to make contact, but the flake was more wont to shift horizontally
 and force realignment between flake and target while trying to put them
 in contact.

Electronic measurement systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The electronic measurements of most material devices were done using a combinati
ons of Keithley instruments with a cryostat, all networked though a desktop
 computer.
 Each instrument was connected through a series of GPIB (IEEE 488) cables,
 and eventually to a computer for controlling the system.
 GPIB is an older protocol and port for connecting and working with instruments,
 but was chosen as it was compatible with all electronics and cryostats
 used in the lab.
 It allows for daisy chaining of multiple instruments together where the
 signal is amplified and passed along cables though the joint connections.
 The protocol is not fault tolerant so care must be taken to ensure instruments
 do not lock up the entire setup, and communication timeouts were set appropriat
ely to deal with instrument reliability while still providing a large enough
 window for data to be taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For semiconductor measurements a Keithley 6430 was typically used to provide
 the DC source bias, as it had the largest voltage range and impedance options
 of the available electronic instruments.
 The 6430 also worked with triax cabling to reduce parasitic capacitance
 while shielding from external EM fields.
 It also measured current or voltage, opposite the supplied bias, that could
 be recorded for two-point data.
 A Keithley 2400 was used to provide gating voltage bias as it works similar
 to the 6430 but with less range and unshielded cabling.
 A Keithley 2182 current source was used for sourcing small current with
 any metallic samples.
 Finally, two Keithley 2182A nano-voltmeters were used in conjunction with
 the other instruments for measuring additional voltages between leads.

All instruments were controlled and monitored from a single LabView program.
 While LabView is a terrible language for writing a larger programs in,
 it was chosen as it integrated well with legacy code and current lab equipment.
 Project Unity contains a series of launchers that contained easy-to-change
 configurations for most of our standard measurements.
 The launcher would then pass the configuration parameters to a separate
 thread to process.
 This allowed multiple measurements to be queued, and for subsequent tasks
 and edited before being run.
 All measurement parameters were saved in the beginning of each data file
 in INI format, to preserve as much of the state as possible with the data,
 while all data was saved in CSV format.
 The main thread was responsible for initial configuration of all tools,
 setting up measurement environments, sending instrument commands, recording
 instrument data, as well as monitoring overall progress and instrument
 status.
 A separate thread was responsible for graphing and fitting live data so
 it did not impact the run time of the main thread.

a, that can be exchanged while the system is filled with liquid helium,
 removing the need to warm the cryostat between samples.
 The puck fits into an inner chamber with wiring pins at the bottom that
 lock into the sample puck.
 The pins are connected electronically to an external port with six pairs

 The Model 6000 controlled helium circulation and chamber temperature though
 an integrated series of electronic valves and an external rotary vane pump
 (Alcatel 2010SD).
 Because helium is a finite resource, all helium gas was sent to be recovered
 though an external helium recovery system.
 The Model 6000 computer system and all add on options were connected to
 the electronics control desktop computer via GPIB, except the magnet system
 which used a separate USB-connected controller.
 This allowed the PPMS to be run using either the Model 6000 interface or
 with the desktop program MultiVu (Quantum Design).
 A .net SDK with LabView interface provided a way to integrate the PPMS temperatu

There are several different lead configurations we use when measuring electrical

 The simplest is a two-terminal rectangular device with uniform dimensions

 However, just having a source and drain lead means all resistances are
 in series and include the contact resistance or Schottky barriers and resistanc
e of the wires which may be undesirable.

For measuring only the resistance of the material we use a four-point device,

b.
 We provide a current bias and measure the voltage between the inner leads
 allowing us to remove the contact resistance.
 Ideally the material is made into a uniform rectangle between the source
 and drain, with arms of material extending to the side.
 This is so the metal contacts are not placed along the main conductance
 channel as the metal may dope the underlying material.
 This construction is more typical for etched film devices, with flakes
 having the leads directly on the crystal due to size limitations and to
 avoid doing the otherwise-unnecessary etching step.
 When measuring, the current is typically biased in both directions to account
 for device inhomogeneities.
 The resistivity of the sample can then be computed
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{1}{\sigma}=\frac{wt}{d}\frac{V_{12}}{I_{D}}=\frac{wt}{d}\frac{V_{12}^{+}-V_{12}^{-}}{I_{D}^{+}-I_{D}^{-}}\label{eq:restivity-3D}

 of equal magnitude,

 The resistance is then measured as a function of channel length which should
 form a linear relationship.
 This can be extrapolated back to a zero-length channel, and thus the resistance
 between the contact and the material.
 A four point measurement is sometimes used for simplicity with the voltage
 measured between the source or drain and the nearest voltage contact, but
 this includes the resistance of some of the channel material so is less
 accurate.

These techniques can be extended though the addition of an external magnetic
 field.
 The simplest is the measurement of a material's magnetoresistance, or magnetoco
nductance, which quantifies the change in channel resistance as a function
 of a perpendicular, out of plane, magnetic field.
 This is used to look for phenomena such as weak (anti-)localization, Shubnikov–
de Haas oscillations, anisotropic magnetoresistance, giant magnetoresistance,
 and others.
 To improve accuracy a combination of voltage measurements are taken with
 both directions of current and field to account for inhomogeneities in
 the device and setup.
 The magnetoresistivity is then

Scanning probe microscopy

\begin_layout Standard
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a series of techniques to produce detailed
 characterization over a 3D surface.
 A long, sharp needle of material is held perpendicular to the plane of
 the surface allowing the SPM to measure the interactions of the tip and
 surface.
 The tip is traced across the plane forming a map of the tip-surface interaction
s.
 Piezoelectric crystals attached to the tip let the tip move in over short
 distances in any direction with fine precision.
 This is often combined with additional motors, such as a stepper motor,
 can move the entire piezoelectric crystals and tip structure over larger
 distances but sacrifice precision to do so.
 With an isolated environment, engineered to shield the tip from external
 noise, and a sharp tip, a SPM map can provide details down to the atomic
 level.
 There are many different varieties of SPM that measure quantities like
 magnetic field, density of states, and spin; and far too many to discuss
 here, so only a brief overview of the most relevant are below.

An atomic force microscope tip on a cantilever extends over a 3D surface
 with varied topography.
 The relative deflection of the tip is measured by a laser reflected off
 the back of the cantilever to a photodector capable of measuring the shifts
 in the horizontal and vertical as the cantilever bends and twists.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure detailed topographical
 information from 3D surfaces with small variations in height.
 The tip is fixed to a small, flexible cantilever and the cantilever is
 extended horizontally over the surface so that the tip points perpendicular
 between the cantilever and surface.
 The tip interactions with the surface will cause the cantilever to bend
 and twist.
 To measure the the movement of the cantilever and tip a laser aligned to
 reflect of the top of the cantilever.
 The top of the cantilever, polished for this purpose, reflects the laser
 to a photodetector.
 As the cantilever flexes and tilts the reflected laser moves across the
 photodetector, optically measuring the tip deflection with great precision.
 The AFM computer monitors the tip deflection as it traces the tip across
 the surface, and can modify the movement in a feedback loop to increase
 measurement precision.
 Because the tip deflection is dependent on the materials involved and other
 interaction conditions, an AFM scan is not a true topography map of the
 surface, but for most purposes they are near-indistinguishable and it is
 typically treated as a topography measurement for most purposes.

There are different methodologies of AFM measurement, though all measure
 some form of force interactions between the tip and the surface.
 As the tip is brought close to the surface it is initially repelled by
 the van der Walls forces, but as the distance continues to decrease the
 force becomes attractive, pulling the tip towards the surface.
 The original method, contact AFM, keeps the tip in the attractive region
 of the force interactions as it moved across the material surface, figure

 The cantilever force is kept constant by moving the cantilever holder up

.
 Non-contact AFM moves the tip farther from the surface than tapping mode,
 so the tip is operating in the repulsive force range.
 The repulsive forces in this range are weaker, so to increase measurement
 precision the frequency is used in place of the amplitude to monitor tip
 forces.
 In this mode the cantilever is driven at or slightly above its resonate
 frequency.
 As the tip approaches the surface the forces cause cantilever to shift
 in oscillation frequency.
 By adjusting cantilever height to keep the frequency constant during a
 scan we again have a measurement of surface topography.
 This has the lowest resolution of the three modes and is the slowest, but
 has the least chance of interacting with the surface, keeping tip and sample
 damage to a minimum

Piezoresponse force microscopy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is an extension of AFM that looks at
 at the electronic response of a surface topography.
 While none of the experimental work in this text contains any PFM data,
 it is an important tool in identifying ferroelectricity in thin films and
 2D flakes, so we discuss it in that context.
 PFM uses a conductive AFM tip and cantilever, often through an added metallic
 surface coating or itself metallic, electrically connected to an external
 voltage source.
 Samples are connected to the same circuit ground, typically by including
 a conductive substrate or material layer underneath.
 The tip is placed in contact with the material to form an electric field
 like two plates of a capacitor.
 As the name suggests, PFM measures the peizo-deformation response of the
 sample as a voltage is applied between the sample and tip.
 This includes movement in the z-direction through vertical tip deflections,
 along with in plane shearing though the twisting of the cantilever as the
 sample moves.
 Combined, this is used to form a vector map of the responses for materials
 with complex responses, such as ferroelectrics with multiple polarization
 axes.
 An alternating voltage bias is used to drive the electric field, usually
 by a lock-in amplifier, and the PFM measures the phase difference and amplitude
 of the tip oscillations.
 The driving frequency and amplitude used by the PFM can play an important
 role in the the sample response and the signal to noise ratio.

 One common method, band excitation, uses a multiple frequency wave pack
 around the cantilever's resonant frequency and the responses combined through
 a simple harmonic oscillator model into a single measurement.
 Alternatively, dual AC resonance tracking, uses the difference in amplitude
 responses above and below the resonant frequency to measure the sample.

There are two common PFM techniques used to identify ferroelectricity, namely
 the observation electromechanical hysteresis loops and remnant states
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "martin2019characterizing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In the first method, the bias voltage is increased and decreased in a positive
 to negative loop at a single point on the surface.
 Past the positive and negative coercive fields, a domain begins to nucleate
 and spreads out with time and increasing voltage.
 In ferroelectrics this shows a butterfly-like hysteresis in phase and loop-like
 hysteresis in amplitude, as seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b.
 The second method uses the PFM to manipulate ferroelectric domains in the
 out of plane direction and their subsequent observation as evidence for
 the domains.
 The dipoles of the domain are aligned by scanning regions of the surface
 with different voltage biases, using the electric fields to form a pattern
 of different domains.
 The surface is then scanned again with the PFM at zero bias, which looks
 for evidence of the altered ferroelectric domain pattern, like what is
 shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PFM-and-ferroelectric-materials"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

c.
 This is often known as domain writing/reading or observation of remnant
 polarization states.
 A square pattern typically chosen is a series of rectangles encompassing
 one anther, but domain manipulation can be used to write complex shapes
 if the sample dimensions support it.
 Both PFM techniques can be used to look for the the crossover from ferroelectri
c to paraelectric as temperature crosses

Caution must be used when using PFM to identify ferroelectric behaviors
 as multiple phenomena cause similar responses.
 A short list of some of the most common follows, and they are discussed
 in depth elsewhere
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The voltage bias from the tip can inject charged particles into the surface
 of the material, and while they typically dissipate after several hours
 in an insulator, the injected trapped charges will appear very similar
 to writing remnant states and hysteresis loops in a ferroelectric.
 Large currents from the tip to the surface can also cause joule heating,
 distorting the lattice and can be again picked up from a subsequent PFM
 scan.
 Strain gradients from the tip putting pressure on thin crystals can reverse
 polarization, the flexoelectric effect.
 The voltage bias from a PFM tip can move ions in a crystal within a unit
 cell or between cells, the former a characteristic of ferroelectric dipoles
 while the latter is ionic conduction.
 Both cause distortion of the crystal structure and are virtually indistinguisha
ble from each other by PFM.
 At high enough electric fields, amplified by the sharp point of the PFM
 tip, the surface chemistry can be altered through electrochemical reactions,
 especially with oxides.
 These changes can be either reversible or irreversible, even within the
 same material using different voltages.

 There are other less common pit-falls not listed here, and ways to mitigate
 some of the problems mentioned, but both are beyond the scope of what should
 be discussed here.
 PFM should almost never be taken as complete proof that a material is ferroelec
tric, but still can be an excellent tool to used to study properties of
 ferroelectric materials such as domain propagation.

Optical second harmonic generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A process frequently used to study crystal structure and material properties
 is optical second harmonic generation (SHG).
 A single frequency laser is used to measure the crystal medium.
 As can be inferred from its name, pairs of photons interact with the medium
 and generate photons at twice the initial frequency.
 Keeping to the electric field contribution, this nonlinear process is described
 mathematically as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(2\omega\right)=\chi^{\left(2\right)}E\left(\omega\right)E\left(\omega\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the induced dipole per unit volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 the electric field from a photon with frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 the three-rank nonlinear susceptibility tensor of the material
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 If we approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 in a multipole expansion
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi^{\left(2\right)}\left(\omega,\vec{q}\right)\ensuremath{\approx}\chi_{ED}^{\left(2\right)}\left(\omega\right)+\chi_{EQ}^{\left(2\right)}\left(\omega\right)+O\left(\vec{q}^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the wave vector of the incident photon, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{ED}$
\end_inset

 is the electric dipole contribution, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{EQ}$
\end_inset

 electric quadrupole
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "denev2011probing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Typically the quadrupole response is much smaller than the dipole, though
 it can still be measured and gives valuable information about some crystal
 structures, but we can neglect it for this discussion.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{EQ}$
\end_inset

 tensor is constrained by several symmetries giving it just 10 independent
 parameters, but most importantly it goes to 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{EQ,ijk}=0$
\end_inset

 in a centrosymmetric system.
 As ferroelectricity can only exist in non-centrosymmetric systems, SHG
 response is an important test to see if a crystal is a possible ferroelectric
 material.

 At a grain boundary or defect, photons can interfere with each other destructiv
ely resulting in a decrease in output intensity compared to a uniform crystal.
 Another area in which SHG excels is identifying phase transitions, such
 as a paraelectric to ferroelectric temperature transition, though the slope

Raman spectroscopy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another optical process often used for crystal characterization of 2D materials
 is Raman spectroscopy, which uses the inelastic scattering of photons to
 measure vibration modes in the material.
 A laser is first used to excite electrons in into a higher virtual energy
 state.
 Most electrons will drop back down to the initial energy level and emit
 a photon with the same frequency as the initial photons, a process known
 as Rayleigh scattering.
 The remaining small percentage of the electrons will interact with phonons
 or other excited states.
 When those electrons return to a lower energy level they emit a photon
 with lower (higher) energy and frequency in a process known as (Anti-)Stokes
 scattering.
 To quantify this, the frequencies of emitted light light are spatially
 separated using a diffraction grating and the relative intensities of each
 frequency is recorded.

 a photon with the respective same, less, or more energy than the absorbed
 photon.
