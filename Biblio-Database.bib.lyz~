	abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of \~{}4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

	abstract = {The pace of two-dimensional materials (2DM) research has been greatly accelerated by the ability to identify exfoliated thicknesses down to a monolayer from their optical contrast. Since this process requires time-consuming and error-prone manual assignment to avoid false-positives from image features with similar contrast, efforts towards fast and reliable automated assignments schemes is essential. We show that by modelling the expected 2DM contrast in digitally captured images, we can automatically identify candidate regions of 2DM. More importantly, we show a computationally-light machine vision strategy for eliminating false-positives from this set of 2DM candidates through the combined use of binary thresholding, opening and closing filters, and shape-analysis from edge detection. Calculation of data pyramids for arbitrarily high-resolution optical coverage maps of two-dimensional materials produced in this way allows the real-time presentation and processing of this image data in a zoomable interface, enabling large datasets to be explored and analysed with ease. The result is that a standard optical microscope with CCD camera can be used as an analysis tool able to accurately determine the coverage, residue/contamination concentration, and layer number for a wide range of presented 2DMs.},

In this work, we present the photolithographic process and the plasma etching of arsenic tri-sulphide (As2S3) film. The films were deposited on thermally oxidized silicon substrates by ultra-fast pulsed laser deposition. To protect As2S3 film from photo-resist developer, thin resist layer \~{}100{\textendash}200nm was remained on the UV exposed area by controlling resist development time. After removing the protective layer in oxygen plasma, As2S3 waveguides were patterned in inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) system using CF4{\textendash}O2 gas mixture. We investigated the etch rate and the etch selectivity to photo-resist of As2S3 as a function of bias power, induction power, operating pressure, and gas flow rate ratio of CF4 and O2. The film is mainly etched by the chemical reaction with fluorine radicals. The content of oxygen in the plasma determines the etched sidewall profiles and nearly vertical profile was obtained at high oxygen content plasma.},

Important concepts and principles in physics and chemistry that govern the formation of the SBH are described in detail, from which the experimental and theoretical results for individual MS interfaces can be understood.

The field dependence of barrier height due to the image force was proposed to be the mechanism for the current through the M-S-M structure when the voltage drop across the reverse-biased barrier is dominating. The proposed model was applied to the I{\textendash}V curves measured at different temperatures on low-resistivity p-type CdTe with Au contacts and the density of the effective acceptors calculated, and the zero-field Schottky barrier height and the Richardson constant were extracted using the activation energy method.

The MSM diode structure is commonly used because an additional MS interface is required for the electrical characterization of MS diodes. A finite charge-injection barrier is generally formed at the additional interface. When a local maximum was detected in the first-order derivative of the measured I-V characteristics for a MSM diode, the parameters for the Schottky contacts, the zero-bias barrier heights of both MS interfaces, the series resistance of the MSM diode, and the effective ideality factor for the MS diode with a higher barrier could be extracted using this method.},

The symmetry breaking is captured by the order parameter known as spontaneous polarization, whose switching under an external electric field results in a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop. In addition, the responses of spontaneous polarization to other external excitations are related to a number of physical effects such as second-harmonic generation, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and dielectric properties. Based on these, this review summarizes recent developments in molecular ferroelectrics since 2011 and focuses on the relationship between symmetry breaking and ferroelectricity, offering ideas for exploring high-performance molecular ferroelectrics.},

We find satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the case of bulk benchmark materials, showing that the so-called electron-phonon renormalization, whose contribution has been traditionally viewed as negligible, is important. We predict out-of-plane pyroelectricity in the recently synthesized Janus MoSSe monolayer and in-plane pyroelectricity in the group-IV monochalcogenide GeS monolayer.

This transistor-type ferroelectric memory has interesting fundamental device physics and potentially large industrial impact. Among various applications of ferroelectric thin films, the development of nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) has been most actively progressed since the late 1980s and reached modest mass production for specific application since 1995. There are two types of memory cells in ferroelectric nonvolatile memories. One is the capacitor-type FeRAM and the other is the field-effect transistor (FET)-type FeRAM. Although the FET-type FeRAM claims the ultimate scalability and nondestructive readout characteristics, the capacitor-type FeRAMs have been the main interest for the major semiconductor memory companies, because the ferroelectric FET has fatal handicaps of cross-talk for random accessibility and short retention time. This book aims to provide the readers with development history, technical issues, fabrication methodologies, and promising applications of FET-type ferroelectric memory devices, presenting a comprehensive review of past, present, and future technologies. The topics discussed will lead to further advances in large-area electronics implemented on glass, plastic or paper substrates as well as in conventional Si electronics.

However, separating ferroelectric effect from many of the factors (such as charge injection/trapping and the presence of mobile ions in the polymer) that confound interpretation is still confusing and controversial. This work presents a methodology to reliably identify the confounding factors which obscure the polarization effect in FeFETs. Careful observation of the Id?Vg curves, as well as monitoring the Id?Vg hysteresis and flat band voltage shift as a function of temperature and sweep frequency, identifies the dominant mechanism. This methodology is demonstrated by using 15 nm thick high glass transition temperature polar polymer-based FeFETs. In these devices, room temperature hysteresis is largely a consequence of charge trapping and mobile ions, while ferroelectric polarization is observed at elevated temperatures. This methodology can be used to unambiguously prove the effect of ferroelectric polarization in FeFETs.},

	abstract = {We present the concept of ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). These junctions consist of two metal electrodes separated by a nanometer-thick ferroelectric barrier. The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed under the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant conduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect inherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The calculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the current-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier thickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge. Remarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to the piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place after the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze the influence of an internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening of polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for asymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable change of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the symmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that characteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from one to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of FTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and depolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar top and bottom electrodes are preferable for the nonvolatile memory applications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.},

Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO3 and both insulating and electron-doped ATiO3 perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO3 (which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO3 and LiOsO3 emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and this mechanism is {\textquoteleft}resistant{\textquoteright} to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising avenues for further research.},

It has been suggested by Anderson and Blount [P. W. Anderson, E. I. Blount, \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} 14, 217-219 (1965)] that a transition from paraelectric phase to FE phase is possible for a metal if, in the paraelectric phase, the electrons at the Fermi level are decoupled from the soft transverse optical phonons, which lead to ferroelectricity. Here, using Raman spectroscopy combined with magnetotransport measurements on a recently discovered FE metal LiOsO$_{\textrm{3}}$, we demonstrate active interplay of itinerant electrons and the FE order: Itinerant electrons cause strong renormalization of the FE order parameter, leading to a more gradual transition in LiOsO$_{\textrm{3}}$ than typical insulating FEs. In return, the FE order enhances the anisotropy of charge transport between parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction. The temperature-dependent evolution of Raman active in-plane $^{\textrm{3}}$E$_{\textrm{g}}$ phonon, which strongly couples to the polar-active out-of-the-plane A$_{\textrm{2u}}$ phonon mode in the high-temperature paraelectric state, exhibits a deviation in Raman shift from the expectation of the pseudospin-phonon model that is widely used to model many insulating FEs. The Curie-Weiss temperature ($\theta$ ? 97 K) obtained from the optical susceptibility is substantially lower than \textit{T}$_{\textrm{s}}$, suggesting a strong suppression of FE fluctuations. Both line width and Fano line shape of $^{\textrm{3}}$E$_{\textrm{g}}$ Raman mode exhibit a strong electron-phonon coupling in the high-temperature paraelectric phase, which disappears in the FE phase, challenging Anderson/Blount{\textquoteright}s proposal for the formation of FE metals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we fabricate a new polar metal film based on the typical ferroelectric material BaTiO3by combining chemical doping and epitaxial strain induced by a substrate. The temperature dependences of the c-axis lattice constant and the second harmonic generation intensity of La-doped BaTiO3films indicate the existence of polar transitions. In addition, through La doping, films become metallic at the polar phase, and metallicity enhancement at the polar state occurs in low-La-doped films. This intriguing behaviour is effectively explained by our first-principles calculations. Our demonstration suggests that the carrier doping to ferroelectric material with epitaxial strain serves as a new way to explore polar metals.},

Because the in-plane polarization persists in the monolayer ferroelectric barrier, the vertical thickness of two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction can be as thin as a monolayer. We show that the monolayer In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe junction provides an embodiment of this strategy. Combining density functional theory calculations with nonequilibrium Green{\textquoteright}s function formalism, we investigate the electron transport properties of In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe and reveal a giant TER effect of 1460\%. The dynamical modulation of both barrier width and barrier height during the ferroelectric switching is responsible for this giant TER effect. These findings provide an important insight into the understanding of the quantum behaviors of electrons in materials at the two-dimensional limit and enable new possibilities for next-generation nonvolatile memory devices based on flexible two-dimensional lateral ferroelectric tunnel junctions.},

However, the controversy on the structures of In2Se3 strongly hinders the exploitation of its properties and potentially gives rise to misdirection of its applications. Here, taking advantage of state-of-the-art aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate the atomic-scale structures of lab-created and purchased In2Se3 compounds. Six phases in three polymorphs at room temperature have been observed among all the samples, which include 2H and 3R $\alpha$-In2Se3, 1T, 2H, and 3R $\beta$-In2Se3, and none-layered $\gamma$-In2Se3. Raman spectra are directly correlated to individual In2Se3 phases, providing fingerprints for identifying various phases of In2Se3. In addition, obvious out-of-plane ferroelectricity of 2H $\alpha$-In2Se3 was also observed by piezoresponse force microscopy, enabling its potential application in ferroelectric devices.},

The temperatures of the invariant equilibria: Liq{\textendash}Liq1{\textendash}In4Se3; Liq{\textendash}In4Se3{\textendash}InSe; Liq{\textendash}InSe{\textendash}In6Se7 and Liq{\textendash}In6Se7{\textendash}In2Se3, Liq{\textendash}In2Se3, In2Se3{\textendash}Liq{\textendash}Liq2, and In2Se3{\textendash}Liq{\textendash}Se have been determined to be, respectively: 794 K; 831 K; 891 K; 938 K, 1041 K, and 491.6 K, with congruent melting of In2Se3 1158.4 K. The experimental studies of the enthalpies of fusion for the four compounds give the following values: $\Delta$Hm,In4Se3=7.7 kJmol-1; $\Delta$Hm,InSe=9.6 kJmol-1; $\Delta$Hm,In6Se7=9.14 kJmol-1, $\Delta$Hf,In2Se3=0.103 kJmol-1 (all per mole of atoms). A non-negligible homogeneity region at about 929 K has been revealed for In6Se7. The temperatures and enthalpies of the polymorphic transitions of In2Se3 (according to the nomenclature used until now) were determined: 471 K ($\alpha${\textrightarrow}$\beta$), 913 K ($\beta${\textrightarrow}$\gamma$) and 1021 K ($\gamma${\textrightarrow}$\delta$), respectively, with $\Delta$Htr$\alpha${\textrightarrow}$\beta$=790 Jmol-1; $\Delta$Htr$\beta${\textrightarrow}$\gamma$=650 Jmol-1; and $\Delta$Htr$\gamma${\textrightarrow}$\delta$=190 Jmol-1. New schemes describing the polytypic transitions of the In2Se3 have been proposed. It is shown that a hexagonal modification a=0.717 nm, c=1.941 nm (most known as $\gamma$(H){\textendash}In2Se3) is stable at room temperature while at temperatures higher than ?823 K it transforms to another hexagonal modification a=0.4025 nm, c=1.9235 nm (predominantly known as $\alpha$(H){\textendash}In2Se3). This one can be quenched to room temperature and both of them produce various other metastable modifications on heating or on cooling. The thermodynamic properties of the four line compounds (In4Se3, InSe, In6Se7 and In2Se3) were revised using literature sources and our experimental data. It is possible that the InSe (and not In2Se3) is the most stable compound in the system indium{\textendash}selenium.},

The photoconductive response of $\alpha$-In2Se3 nanosheets extends into ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral regions. The high photocurrent response is attributed to the direct band gap (EG = 1.3 eV) of In2Se3 combined with a large surface-area-to-volume ratio and a self-terminated/native-oxide-free surface, which help to reduce carrier recombination while keeping fast response, allowing for real-time detection under very low-light conditions.},

Particularly, using electron microscopy and correlative in situ micro-Raman and electrical measurements, we show that, in contrast to bulk single crystals, the $\beta$ phase can persist in single-crystal thin layers at room temperature (RT). The single-crystal nature of the layers before and after the phase transition allows for unambiguous determination of changes in the electrical resistivity. Specifically, the $\beta$ phase has an electrical resistivity about 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude lower than the $\alpha$ phase. Furthermore, we find that the temperature of the $\alpha$ {\textrightarrow} $\beta$ phase transformation increases by as much as 130 K with the layer thickness decreasing from \~{}87 nm to \~{}4 nm. These single-crystal thin layers are ideal for studying the scaling behavior of the phase transformations and associated changes of the electrical properties. For these In2Se3 thin layers, the accessibility of the $\beta$ phase at RT, with distinct electrical properties than the $\alpha$ phase, provides the basis for multilevel phase-change memories in a single material system.},

Die Phasenverh{\"a}ltnisse des polymorphen In2Se3 wurden mit Hilfe von R{\"o}ntgenheizaufnahmen untersucht. Die bei Raumtemperatur stabile Modifikation $\gamma$-In2Se3 (hP30) mit vier-und f{\"u}nffacher Koordination des Indiums zeigt bei 960 K eine Phasenumwandlung in das dichter gepackte $\beta$-In2Se3(H) (hP10) (KZ = 6?), welches bei 1080 K in das stark fehlgeordnete $\delta$-In2Se3 (hP5) {\"u}bergeht. Beim Abk{\"u}hlen der Hochtemperaturformen erh{\"a}lt man gew{\"o}hnlich nicht $\gamma$-In2Se3, sondern Varianten des $\beta$-In2Se3, n{\"a}mlich $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) ($\alpha$(2)-In2Se3) (hP10) und $\alpha$-In2Se3(R) ($\alpha$(3)-In2Se3) (hR5), die beim Aufheizen {\"u}ber die ebenfalls metastabilen Formen $\beta$'-In2Se3 (hP15) und $\beta$-In2Se3(R) (hR5) in das stabile $\gamma$-In2Se3 {\"u}bergehen. Bei Raumtemperatur stabil bzw. metastabil sind nur $\gamma$-In2Se3, $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) und $\alpha$-In2Se3(R). Die Infrarotspektren und r{\"o}ntgenographischen Dichten der verschiedenen polymorphen Formen des In2Se3 sowie die Art der Phasenumwandlungen werden diskutiert.
The phase relationships of polymorphic In2Se3 were reinvestigated by high-temperature X-ray powder studies. The modification, which is (contrary to most references) stable at room temperature, is $\gamma$-In2Se3 (hP30) with four-fold and fivefold coordinated indium ions. Above 960 K $\gamma$-In2Se3 undergoes a phase transition to the more dense (CN = 6?) $\beta$-In2Se3(H) (hP10), which changes to $\delta$-In2Se3 (hP5) above 1080 K. On cooling the high-temperature polymorphs to ambient temperature the stable $\gamma$-In2Se3 is not normally obtained, but metastable variants of $\beta$-In2Se3, viz. $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) ($\alpha$(2)-In2Se3) (hP10) or $\alpha$-In2Se3(R) ($\alpha$(3)-In2Se3) (hR5), which transform on heating via the similarly metastable $\beta$'-In2Se3 (hP15) and $\beta$-In2Se3(R) (hR5), respectively, into $\gamma$-In2Se3. The only stable or metastable polymorphs which exist at ambient temperature are $\gamma$-In2Se3, $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) and $\alpha$-In2Se3(R). The IR spectra and X-ray densities of the various polymorphs of In2Se3 as well as the phase transitions are discussed in terms of the possible structures.},

The collected data of two twinned crystal specimens were refined (finalR1 = 0.0315 and 0.0559 for 1553 and 1602 independent reflections withI{\textgreater} 2$\sigma$I, respectively). The structure is built up by In(1)Se5trigonal bipyramids and distorted In(2)Se4tetrahedra resulting in a distorted wurtzite-type-like arrangement. $\gamma$-In2Se3is the room-temperature polymorph of indium(III) selenide contrary to some other reports in the literature, e.g., Julienet al.(1985) (3).},

The hexagonal nanoplates show photoresponses at positive bias, thus is considered as a potential material for photoanode utilization. In order to further improve the photoelectrocatalytic performance of $\kappa$-In2Se3, MoS2 nanopetals are introduced by a solution-based ultrasonic method. The In2Se3/MoS2 heterojunction exhibits a significantly higher photocurrent density and higher PEC O2 evolution amount than those of pristine In2Se3. PL test shows that the charge separation is promoted, due to numerous p-n junctions formed at the interfaces of In2Se3/MoS2. This led to more efficient utilization of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance is greatly reduced by the cooperative interaction of the two materials.},

In this work, $\gamma$-In2Se3 nanoparticles with predominantly exposed \{110\} facets are synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). EDTA plays a key role in regulating the exposed \{110\} facets and by adding 0.04 M of EDTA, tetragonal prismatic $\gamma$-In2Se3 nanoparticles with the \{110\} facets are produced. Studies of the photocatalytic activity of tetracycline (TC) reveal that the tetragonal prismatic $\gamma$-In2Se3 prepared with 0.04 M EDTA has the optimal activity that is about 1.9 times higher than that of conical $\gamma$-In2Se3 prepared without EDTA.

This feature has plagued its characterization over the years, with reported band gaps varying in an unacceptable range of 1 eV. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and the HSE06 hybrid functional, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of four layered phases of In2Se3, addressing their relative stability and the nature of their fundamental band gaps, i.e., direct versus indirect. Our results show large disparities between fundamental and optical gaps. The absorption coefficients are found to be as high as those in direct-gap III-V semiconductors. The band alignment with respect to conventional semiconductors indicate a tendency to n-type conductivity, explaining recent experimental observations.},

The phase of the nanowires is analyzed using a high-resolution transmission microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrical conductivity and photoresponse characteristics are significantly enhanced in the $\alpha$-phase due to smaller bandgap structure compared to the $\kappa$-phase nanowires. The spectral responsivities of the $\alpha$-phase devices are 200 times larger than those of the $\kappa$-phase devices.

In this work, we investigate 2D In2Se3 synthesized via chemical vapor deposition, a recently discovered 2D ferroelectric material. We observed that In2Se3 layers with thickness ranging from a single layer to \~{}20 layers stabilized at the $\beta$ phase with a superstructure at room temperature. At around 180 K, the $\beta$ phase converted to a more stable $\beta$' phase that was distinct from previously reported phases in 2D In2Se3. The kinetics of the reversible thermally driven $\beta$-to-$\beta$' phase transformation was investigated by temperature-dependent transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, corroborated with the expected minimum-energy pathways obtained from our first-principles calculations. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal in-plane ferroelectricity in the $\beta$' phase. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show that the indirect bandgap of monolayer $\beta$' In2Se3 is 2.50 eV, which is larger than that of the multilayer form with a measured value of 2.05 eV. Our results on the reversible thermally driven phase transformation in 2D In2Se3 with thickness down to the monolayer limit and the associated electronic properties will provide insights to tune the functionalities of 2D In2Se3 and other emerging 2D ferroelectric materials and shed light on their numerous potential applications (e.g., nonvolatile memory devices).},

	abstract = {Layered indium selenides (In2Se3) have recently been discovered to host robust out-of-plane and in-plane ferroelectricity in the $\alpha$- and $\beta$'-phases, respectively. In this work, we utilize angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to directly measure the electronic band structure of $\beta$'-In2Se3 and compare to hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In agreement with DFT, we find the band structure is highly two-dimensional, with negligible dispersion along the c-axis. Because of n-type doping we can observe the conduction band minima and directly measure the minimum indirect (0.97 eV) and direct (1.46 eV) bandgaps. We find the Fermi surface in the conduction band is characterized by anisotropic electron pockets with sharp in-plane dispersion about the M? points, yielding effective masses of 0.21m0 along KM and 0.33m0 along $\Gamma$M. The measured band structure is well supported by hybrid density functional theory calculations. The highly two-dimensional (2D) band structure with moderate bandgap and small effective mass suggests that $\beta$'-In2Se3 is a potentially useful van der Waals semiconductor. This, together with its ferroelectricity makes it a viable material for high-mobility ferroelectric{\textendash}photovoltaic devices, with applications in nonvolatile memory switching and renewable energy technologies.},
