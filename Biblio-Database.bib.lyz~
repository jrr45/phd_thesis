	abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of \~{}4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

	abstract = {The pace of two-dimensional materials (2DM) research has been greatly accelerated by the ability to identify exfoliated thicknesses down to a monolayer from their optical contrast. Since this process requires time-consuming and error-prone manual assignment to avoid false-positives from image features with similar contrast, efforts towards fast and reliable automated assignments schemes is essential. We show that by modelling the expected 2DM contrast in digitally captured images, we can automatically identify candidate regions of 2DM. More importantly, we show a computationally-light machine vision strategy for eliminating false-positives from this set of 2DM candidates through the combined use of binary thresholding, opening and closing filters, and shape-analysis from edge detection. Calculation of data pyramids for arbitrarily high-resolution optical coverage maps of two-dimensional materials produced in this way allows the real-time presentation and processing of this image data in a zoomable interface, enabling large datasets to be explored and analysed with ease. The result is that a standard optical microscope with CCD camera can be used as an analysis tool able to accurately determine the coverage, residue/contamination concentration, and layer number for a wide range of presented 2DMs.},

In this work, we present the photolithographic process and the plasma etching of arsenic tri-sulphide (As2S3) film. The films were deposited on thermally oxidized silicon substrates by ultra-fast pulsed laser deposition. To protect As2S3 film from photo-resist developer, thin resist layer \~{}100{\textendash}200nm was remained on the UV exposed area by controlling resist development time. After removing the protective layer in oxygen plasma, As2S3 waveguides were patterned in inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) system using CF4{\textendash}O2 gas mixture. We investigated the etch rate and the etch selectivity to photo-resist of As2S3 as a function of bias power, induction power, operating pressure, and gas flow rate ratio of CF4 and O2. The film is mainly etched by the chemical reaction with fluorine radicals. The content of oxygen in the plasma determines the etched sidewall profiles and nearly vertical profile was obtained at high oxygen content plasma.},

Existing models of the SBH are too simple to realistically treat the chemistry exhibited at MS interfaces. This article points out, through examination of available experimental and theoretical results, that a comprehensive, quantum-mechanics-based picture of SBH formation can already be constructed, although no simple equations can emerge, which are applicable for all MS interfaces. Important concepts and principles in physics and chemistry that govern the formation of the SBH are described in detail, from which the experimental and theoretical results for individual MS interfaces can be understood. Strategies used and results obtained from recent investigations to systematically modify the SBH are also examined from the perspective of the physical and chemical principles of the MS interface.},

Schottky barriers are shown to be present for a variety of metals with the work functions spanning over 4.2{\textendash}6.1 eV. Except for the p-type Schottky contact with platinum, the Fermi levels in all of the studied metal{\textendash}MoS2 complexes are situated above the midgap of MoS2. The mechanism of the Fermi level pinning at metal{\textendash}MoS2 contact is shown to be unique for metal{\textendash}2D-semiconductor interfaces, remarkably different from the well-known Bardeen pinning effect, metal-induced gap states, and defect/disorder induced gap states, which are applicable to traditional metal{\textendash}semiconductor junctions. At metal{\textendash}MoS2 interfaces, the Fermi level is partially pinned as a result of two interface behaviors: first by a metal work function modification by interface dipole formation due to the charge redistribution, and second by the production of gap states mainly of Mo d-orbitals character by the weakened intralayer S{\textendash}Mo bonding due to the interface metal{\textendash}S interaction. This finding would provide guidance to develop approaches to form Ohmic contact to MoS2.},

The voltage distributions along the M-S-M structure were numerically determined and found that the voltage drop across the reverse-biased Schottky barrier is dominating at the low bias voltage, and the dominant range depends on the value of the resistor of the semiconductor bulk. The field dependence of barrier height due to the image force was proposed to be the mechanism for the current through the M-S-M structure when the voltage drop across the reverse-biased barrier is dominating. The proposed model was applied to the I{\textendash}V curves measured at different temperatures on low-resistivity p-type CdTe with Au contacts and the density of the effective acceptors calculated, and the zero-field Schottky barrier height and the Richardson constant were extracted using the activation energy method. The extracted parameters fitted well with that published for the same material structure.},

We show that even in the case when the second contact is also of Schottky type but with different barrier height, current{\textendash}voltage characteristic remains very similar as that of single Schottky diode. The existence of the second Schottky diode with lower-barrier height may not be detectable by inspecting I{\textendash}V curves of such structure. The analysis and Schottky diode parameter extraction also may not be able to disclose existence of two Schottky contacts in the studied structure. The structure behaves as it would be one single Schottky contact. This knowledge may be used in technology where in many cases the ohmic contact may be substituted by another Schottky contact with lower-barrier height.},

The MSM diode structure is commonly used because an additional MS interface is required for the electrical characterization of MS diodes. A finite charge-injection barrier is generally formed at the additional interface. When a local maximum was detected in the first-order derivative of the measured I-V characteristics for a MSM diode, the parameters for the Schottky contacts, the zero-bias barrier heights of both MS interfaces, the series resistance of the MSM diode, and the effective ideality factor for the MS diode with a higher barrier could be extracted using this method.},

	abstract = {Ferroelectrics are inseparable from symmetry breaking. Accompanying the paraelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition, the paraelectric phase adopting one of the 32 crystallographic point groups is broken into subgroups belonging to one of the 10 ferroelectric point groups, i.e. C1, C2, C1h, C2v, C4, C4v, C3, C3v, C6 and C6v. The symmetry breaking is captured by the order parameter known as spontaneous polarization, whose switching under an external electric field results in a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop. In addition, the responses of spontaneous polarization to other external excitations are related to a number of physical effects such as second-harmonic generation, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and dielectric properties. Based on these, this review summarizes recent developments in molecular ferroelectrics since 2011 and focuses on the relationship between symmetry breaking and ferroelectricity, offering ideas for exploring high-performance molecular ferroelectrics.},
