Ferroelectricity

\begin_layout Standard
Ferroelectric crystals will spontaneously polarize when below a critical
 temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{C}$

).
 Below 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{C}$

 atom locations will create naturally occurring dipoles as they shift to
 find the lowest overall energy state, sacrificing local electrostatic homogenei
ty to do so.
 At higher temperatures the atoms have more energy and space and generally
 prefer neutrality, forming a paraelectric material instead.
 When a ferroelectric is exposed to an electric field the dipoles shift
 to align with the electric field and will remain aligned when that field
 is removed.
 Paraelectric materials may form similar dipoles under the electric field
 but will return to their unpolarized state when the field is removed.
 Ferroelectrics have many applications, as the polarization can be used
 to enhance capacitors, hold a persistent electronic configuration, or modify
 other device properties.

Piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity

Piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity arise from non-linear behaviors in
 crystal structures.

 There are 32 crystal classes that make up 3D crystals.
 Of those 21 are non-centrosymmetric, and 20 of the non-centrosymmetric
 groups form piezoelectric materials.
 Furthermore, 10 of those groups are polar, forming dipoles with the material.
 Crystals from these 10 groups are pyroelectric and possibly ferroelectric.
 All ferroelectrics possess pyroelectricity and all pyroelectrics are piezoelect
ric, but not all pyroelectrics are ferroelectric and not all piezoelectrics
 are pyroelectric.
 This encircling Venn diagram provides a way for easily screening possible
 ferroelectrics but also means ferroelectrics materials have other attributes.
 Appendix

\begin_layout Standard
In piezoelectric crystals, mechanical motion and polarization are bound
 together.
 Applying mechanical strain or stress that shifts the atom locations in
 the material shifting the dipole orientation or displacement.
 This generates an electric field and the aggregate can be measured as a
 voltage across the material.
 Applied in reverse, an electric field will cause the dipoles within the
 materials to displace, and provided they are aligned, alter the the crystal
 size and shape.
 This has wide applications, giving rise to rapid, precise electric motors
 and sensors used throughout modern society.

In pyroelectricity crystal polarization is conjoined with changes in temperature.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

 If we heat or cool a pyroelectric crystal, the crystal structure is altered
 slightly allowing it to spontaneous polarize, or if already polarized,
 change to a new polarization fitting the new atom placement.
 This polarization produces a voltage across the bulk of the crystal, providing
 a method to measure this change and thus the changing temperature that
 drove the re-polarization.
 After the temperature is fixed the voltage will generally dissipate though
 leakage currents.
 This makes pyroelectrics suitable for changing measurements like thermal
 imaging cameras and energy generation, but poor for managing persistent
 states in modern digital electronics.

Ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), 1T cell, seek to keep a
 persistent on/off binary state.
 A ferroelectric dielectric replaces the typical oxide gate dielectric of
 a (MOS)FET, using the gate to switch the polarization of the crystal, figure

\end_inset

.
 The polarization of the material should maintain an electric field along
 the junction with the semiconductor, providing the normal enhancement or
 depletion of the channel.
 As a normal FET, a conducting channel is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and conversely, current reduced below a threshold can be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

off.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 While as the polarization persists the channel state should remain on or
 off, sustaining it without power.
 This has the potential to replace or augment DRAM in computers and low
 power devices, reducing active energy consumption or possibly allowing
 electronics to turn on without a lengthy start.
 FeFETs also offer the possibility of faster switching than traditional
 capacitor-based RAM.

 Once the coercive electric field is reached, the dipoles begin to align,

 Further decreasing the gate voltage to the

 The electric field of the gate depletes the channel of carriers, giving
 the desired diminutive drain current.
 When the gate voltage is again returned to 0 V the polarization preserves
 the depletion field within the channel until the gate is switched to

 field is reduced below the threshold of the coercive field, eventually
 leading to the depolarization of the device.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the piratical challenges of FeFETs is increasing the longevity of
 the polarization state.
 Often thermal energy may cause the polarization to relax over time as the
 dipoles reorient so materials must be chosen to minimize this effect.
 Likely the largest cause of long term polarization degradation is leakage
 current through the gate.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 A common modification of FeFETs is to include a dielectric layer between
 the ferroelectric and semiconductor to improve the interface between the
 two (MFIS-FET) and reduce leak currents higher energy electrons from damaging
 the ferroelectric.
 Another is to add a floating metal and dielectric layer forming a metal-ferroel
ectric and channel (MFMIS-FET) to redistribute the electric field evenly
 over the channel and reduce the effect of domain formation within the ferroelec
tric.
 Improving film quality to reduce trapped charges, increasing the metal-ferroele
ctric Schottky barrier, and using a high-k dielectric can be used to further
 reduce leak currents in a FeFET.

 Another common challenge with producing a commercial FeFET RAM is fatigue
 in the ferroelectric layer as conventional RAM is expected to be able to
 switch

\begin_layout Subsection
Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are an alternative to FeFETs being
 explored for data storage.
 They consist of a thin ferroelectric in between two metal electrodes, where
 the ferroelectric polarization is along the axis of the metal-ferroelectric-met
al structure.
 The polarization direction will produce a net positive and negative charge
 distribution in the ferroelectric along the respective electrode junction.
 The electrons in the metal will adjust to screen out the charge at the
 junction, all together producing a varying potential across the junction.
 When a voltage is placed across the FTJ some electrons will tunnel though
 the barrier forming a measurable current.
 The voltage produces an electric field across the ferroelectric, and if
 large enough will cause the polarization to switch.
 The switched polarization will alter the potential across the two junctions
 and the tunneling current.
 By measuring the current at a particular voltage it is possible to determine
 which direction the polarization is orientated giving rise to a binary
 state that can be used to store information.
