Ferroelectrics, already ubiquitous in many modern applications, have the
 potential to enable fast and low power persistent memory devices.
 The recent demonstration of a ferroelectric-semiconductor ferroelectric
 field effect transistor (FeSmFETs) by Si et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 has given us a novel method to induce persistent states in a field effect
 transistor channel.
 This behavior in part, is enabled by the coupled in-plane and out-of-plane
 polarization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ensuremath{\alpha}\textrm{-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

, a relatively unique property among ferroelectrics.
 Before FeSmFETs can be used in commercial devices we must establish the
 impact of changing conditions, such as device temperature, have on the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ensuremath{\alpha}\textrm{-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 polarization, persistent states, and overall device behavior.
 Here we report evidence for the a metallic state formed by an electric
 field in 
\begin_inset Formula $\ensuremath{\alpha}\textrm{-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 FeSmFETs, measured from room to liquid helium temperatures.
 Our devices display clear evidence that the polarization alters the current,
 however, the emergence of the metallic behavior is more consistent with
 a disorder-driven transition in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ensuremath{\alpha}\textrm{-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Ferroelectrics are typically thought of as insulators or wide-band gap
 semiconductors, with a few recent reports that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{WTe_{2}}$
\end_inset

 is the first ferroelectric metal.
 A metallic state in a ferroelectric semiconductor may be an alternative
 path to understand the coupling of bound and itinerant electrons in a ferroelec
tric and polar metals.
 Additionally, we confirm of the feasibility of FeSmFET devices as an alternativ
e to traditional ferroelectric field effect transistors.

) are a natural evolution to field effect transistors (FET), providing a
 means of maintaining the transistor state without the need for a constant
 gate voltage.
 Typically this is achieved as a standard FET with a ferroelectric replacing
 gate dielectric

 Further engineering for use in devices like ferroelectric random access

 the field, and adapt the FinFET design to utilize this design

 FeFET commercialization, in FRAM and beyond, still faces many engineering
 challenges including retention duration, finding an optimal coercive field
 and polarization strength, leakage current through the ferroelectric dielectric
, material interface mismatches, limits to minimization of the ferroelectric

 With the use of conductive ferroelectric compounds, we can construct a

 transistors (FeSmFETs or FeSFETs) which may one day address the aforementioned
 obstacles.
 FeSmFETs allow a wide range of stable states that are of interest for neuromorp

\begin_layout Standard
In 2017 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}(3R)-}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\beta}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 were first predicted to be ferroelectric down to one unit cell by Ding
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ding2017prediction"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-}$
\end_inset

phase prediction, for both the 2H and 3R polytypes, indicated a combined
 binary in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) polarization as the selenium
 atom shifted in the lattice.
 This feature is rather unique among known ferroelectrics, and may allow
 the OOP polarization to persist down to a single unit cell.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\beta}-}$
\end_inset

phase was also predicted to show binary IP polarization, though the ferroelectri
c phase may be better known as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\prime}$
\end_inset

-phase, see the discussion in section

.
 Typically, in insulating ferroelectrics, a capacitor is made with the ferroelec
tric to measure polarization switching.
 By applying a voltage wave and measuring the current over time we can see
 the charge on the capacitor for a given electric field.
 Due to the nature of ferroelectric semiconductors, current conducts through
 the material before, during, and after the polarization switching in such
 a measurement.
 In lieu of the capacitor measurements on 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

, many disparate experiments form a pool of evidence for the existence of
 ferroelectricity.
 Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 show breaking of inversion symmetry
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, a necessary requirement for ferroelectricity.
 Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has also shown evidence supporting
 ferroelectricity though the hysteresis loops and remnant polarized domains

LatexCommand cite
key "cui2018intercorrelated,wan2018roomtemperature,hou2019resistive,dai2020intrinsic,hou2019ain2se3"

, but PFM can often give false positives as similar responses arise from
 other phenomena
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vasudevan2017ferroelectric"

\end_inset

.
 To counter this, some authors have looked at the correlation between IP
 and OOP PFM responses

, as well as observing IP electric fields altering the OOP polarization
 measured by PFM

 Both methods reducing the possibilities of what may be producing false
 positives.

The most compelling experimental verification of ferroelectricity in 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 comes from several distinct devices that show signs of polarization.
 The first by Wan et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wan2019nonvolatile"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, an 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

/graphene heterostructure FET.
 The FET gate electric field produced and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 polarization shifted the graphene channel fermi-level relative to the charge
 neutral point.
 This formed two peaks in the channel resistance as gate voltage was swept
 and the fermi-level passes though the charge neutral point.
 The authors use this to estimate a polarization value of 0.92 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\mu C/cm^{2}}$
\end_inset

, similar to the original theoretical prediction of 0.6 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\mu C/cm^{2}}$

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 sweeps below the coercive field threshold, the devices act as a typical
 semiconductor channel.
 Above the threshold voltage the device current shows a significant change
 in slope, and a large hysteresis between increasing and decreasing voltage
 sweeps.
 The switching behavior is discussed more in section

 Finally, Si et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 reported the first FeSmFET using thin crystals of
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 with gate dielectric of 90-nm-thick 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 or 15-nm-thick 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{HfO_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 When gated, the channel current showed a large hysteresis, forming clockwise
 and counterclockwise loops with the respective gate dielectric, and persisting
 down to liquid helium temperatures.
 Below, we detail the manufacture and measurement of similar 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$

\begin_layout Standard
Thin crystals of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 were grown by a modified Bridgman method.
 Transport measurements were carried out on both bulk and thin mechanically-exfo
liated crystals.
 For bulk resistivity measurements, silver paint was used to form conductive
 terminals.
 In-plane resistivity measurements were carried out using a hall bar pattern
 along the longest axis of the bulk crystal.
 For out-of-plane measurements, to ensure a fresh surface, the previous
 leads were removed with a razor before new leads were added on.
 A modified four-point pattern was used to accommodate the thin c-axis of
 the crystal: a current lead was placed in the center of the crystal on
 the opposing sides of the c-axis with a voltage lead encircling each current
 lead.

Flakes of thin crystals of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Si:P/Si}\textrm{O}_{2}$
\end_inset

 were manufactured using mechanical exfoliation as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Mechanical-flake-exfoliation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Flakes were identified using an optical microscope and atomic force microscopy
 was used to establish a rough optical color code to judge the thickness
 of the flakes.
 Below 20nm, flakes hue remained blue but appeared increasingly transparent
 as thickness decreased.
 To promote better van der Walls adhesion of the flake to the substrate,
 the latter was first cleaned in Nanostrip, Acetone, 2-Proponal, and DI-water,
 before flake exfoliation, and the substrate was heated to 100C while in
 contact with the tape prior to the final removal.
 After optical identification, flake-substrates were kept in a drybox, or
 later in vacuum, to avoid water contamination and oxidation.

 produced better contacts, but inconstantly, and only worked with thicker
 devices.
 To circumvent this effect, we modified our lithography step to only allow
 solvent developers in contact with the flake material, with the procedure
 described in section

 5 nm of titanium and 45 nm of gold was evaporated using either a Lab-18
 Thin Film Deposition System (Kurt J.

 The excess material was removed using the solvent Remover-PG (Microchem).

 All measurements were carried out in low vacuum, less than 1 mTorr, in
 a Model 6000 Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design).
 A Keithley 6340 was used as the current and voltage bias source as well
 as the corresponding two-point voltage and current measurements, two Keithley
 2182A were used for four-point and hall measurements across the voltage
 leads, and a Keithley 2400 was used to provide the gate voltage bias.

 All of the samples were first fit for power-law behaviors in different
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 regions, examining the linearity in 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(I_{D}\right)$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(V_{DS}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The values of the various fit slopes 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 are listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and may indicate a relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D}\propto V_{DS}^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Samples A and B showed a more disjointed behavior with positive 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

, while samples C and D were more consistent between negative and positive
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

.
 This may be a result of the reduced thickness of samples A and B.
 Samples C and D shows an exponent (slope) near 1 for positive 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 at lower voltages suggesting quasi-ohmic conduction, then transition to
 exponents ~0.5 which would better match Schottky-like behavior
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "xia2007fieldinduced"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The negative 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 appears to largely show the same exponent of 1-1.5 throughout the entire
 range.
 For positive 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 the slopes of samples C and D were near 1 at low voltages which suggests
 the conduction was quasi-Ohmic in behavior.
 At higher voltages the slopes dropped to be near 0.5, implying Schottky-like
 conduction.
 Examining the samples as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(I_{D}\right)$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}^{1/2}$
\end_inset

, both display a linear relationship for larger positive voltages, further
 supporting that this region fits the Schottky model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Samples A (and B) with positive 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 and increasing gate voltage, both show multiple changes in slope.
 The slope is large (2-5) below ~1.5 V (3 V), decreases until 3 V (6V), then
 shows a significant uptick as the voltage is further increased.
 The distance between the center leads used for the source and drain account
 for the difference between the two samples, making the regions consistent
 in electric field.
 This transition can be attributed to the Schottky barriers of the contacts.
 Sample B has a much wider contact area, around six-fold that of A, which
 would diminish this effect and likely explains why the transitions are
 not as pronounced.
 This switching effect can also be seen in the negative 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 for sample A, though not B, likely because of this difference in contact
 area.
 Neither sample showed this switching with decreasing gate voltage, which
 displayed largely quasi-Ohmic current.
 This switching behavior is likely the result of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 polarization altering the size of the Schottky barrier, with the electric
 field from the increasing gate voltage reseting the polarization and barrier
 height.
 Other models are often used to describe the switching behavior in ferroelectric
 semiconductor tunnels, including Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, space charge
 limited conduction (SCLC), Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission models
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "borkar2017experimental"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The former is a contact limited conduction model, the latter two are bulk
 conduction limited current models.
 None of the device behaviors fit well to any of these theories, which were
 ruled out based on their 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D}$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 relationships.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between the polarization and the Schottky barriers is more
 pronounced when the source-drain voltage is swept continuously between
 the max positive and negative voltages in sample A.
 With positive 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 there is a large hysteresis in the current that is can be attributed to
 the polarization, as the effects of traps is unlikely to produce this countercl
ockwise-counterclockwise behavior.
 The asymmetry is likely the result of the differing electrode contacts,
 the asymmetry in contact area can be readily seen in figure

 disorder scattering, or some combination of the two.
 Of the former, one of the most prevalent is the prediction that in 2D semicondu

 a Wigner-Mott transition

 In a Mott insulator carriers localize to form spin 1/2 bound states in
 the potential wells of Coulomb repulsion from surrounding carriers, and
 at increased carrier density the carriers overcome the repulsion and form
 a Fermi liquid.
 A second common suggestion is that MITs may result from percolation in
 layered semiconductors

 In a 2D semiconductor a small change in carrier density leads to a large
 change in screening, and at low carrier density and screening the disorder
 of the system has a significant impact on the carrier conduction.
 Theoretical predictions also have suggested disorder from charge trapping

 The metallic state in sample B was no longer apparent after annealing for
 three hours.
 The process likely removed surface contaminates and reduced disorder in
 the system, but also may have altered the barrier height between the contacts
 and the polarized crystal; making it difficult to relate the effect of
 the annealing treatment to the mechanism for the metallic state.

From the 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D}$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$
\end_inset

 in-plane current sweep hysteresis, attributed to the double Schottky barriers
 in ferroelectric-semiconductor devices, we have evidence that polarization
 switching is observable in our devices.
 We may postulate that the ferroelectric nature of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$
\end_inset

 crystal likely plays some role in or interacts with the origin of the observed
 metallic state.
 There are several likely models describing the relationship of ferroelectricity
 and current at various temperatures: Schottky, Schottky-Simmons, Poole-Frenkel,
 and space charge limited conduction (SCLC).
 Examining the Schottky model and assuming a constant voltage we would expect
 a linear relationship when examining the current-temperature relationship
 in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(J/T^{2/3}\right)\propto1/T$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, for the Schottky-Simmons model: 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(J/T^{2}\right)\propto1/T$
\end_inset

, both are discussed more in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to be a result of the polarization altering the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$

-contact barriers, though it could still play a role.
 The bulk resistance also appears to be larger than the contact resistance,
 as can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sample-D-contact-resistance"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As the gate voltage was increased both the sample and contact resistance
 dropped, though the latter was much more significant.
 The contact measurement includes a small portion of the crystal in the
 measurement so this effect may be larger if the crystal can be completely
 subtracted from the measurement.
 Examining the cross section of the increasing current and temperature using
 Poole-Frenkel emission we would expect the relationship

To further understand the how disorder and ferroelectricity interact in
 this MIT more work is needed.
 Encapsulating the FeSmFET appears to drastically alter the behavior of
 the ferroelectric channel, but this could be attributed to both charge
 trapping and to the OOP polarization of the channel.
 Additionally, the dielectric material has been shown to alter the direction
 of the hysteresis but this effect has not been thoroughly investigated.
 Furthermore, the effect of contamination of water and air on the metallic
 state should be excluded.
 PFM and optical illumination may serve to help us understand the intersection
 of polarization and disorder in the MIT as they can be used to manipulate
 FeSmFETs without altering the devices.
 Future simulations that take into account disorder in the crystal along
 with the polarization barrier shift may help to resolve the nature of the
 metallic state.

-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DS}$

 behavior that is consistent with polarization controlled double-Schottky
 barriers seen in ferroelectric channel devices.
 The hysteresis in the transfer characteristics appears to be dominated
 by trapped charge and disorder at higher temperatures but still shows signs
 of polarization at liquid helium temperatures.
 However, none of the common bulk carrier limited or barrier limited transport
 mechanisms matched well with the temperature dependence of the metallic
 behavior.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\ensuremath{\alpha}-In}_{2}\textrm{Se}_{3}$

 FeSmFETs maintain a persistent state after the removal of the gate voltage,
 which has the potential for applications in low power device memories and
 neuromorphic computing.
 Additionally, with only one experimentally verified ferroelectric metal
