  abstract = {We report on the high-temperature operation and reliability of the Si-doped hafnium oxide (HSO) ferroelectric FET (FeFET) emerging memory. In this study, we explore the role of high-temperature operation of the ferroelectric (FE) material on the FeFET in the temperature range of 40-120 \textdegree C. The inverse memory window (MW) dependence on temperature leads to a very small MW size ( 300 mV) at 120 \textdegree C. The recovery of MW size at room temperature (RT) indicates a potential pyroelectric effect as a cause for MW closure upon high-temperature operation. The FeFET state readout shows pronounced effects to erase (ER) threshold voltage (Vth) shift, due to the decrease in remnant polarization and improved substrate Vth shift as the temperature increases. The endurance reliability measured for temperature range (-40 \textdegree C to 40 \textdegree C) with 105 cycles shows a maximized initial MW at low temperatures, whereas higher postcycling interface trap generation occurs as the temperature increases. The FeFET 10 h retention tests at 0 \textdegree C and 40 \textdegree C were extrapolated to ten years and indicated stable properties independent of temperature. The depolarization field (Ed) dependence on the FeFET stack parameters is studied based on an analytical formula. The Ed decreases with increased permittivity of the FE, interface layer (IL), and increased FE film thickness. Substrate doping and temperature seem to have a small impact on Ed, whereas the FE-IL area ratio tuning below unity lowers the Ed. The role of pyroelectric effect on the FeFET memory and operating temperature-induced endurance and retention reliability concerns are discussed.},

A distinct intermediate regime then emerges as a precursor of such a Wigner-Mott transition, which is characterized by both charge and spin correlations, displaying large mass enhancements and strong renormalizations of other Fermi-liquid parameters. Here we present a careful study of a quarter-filled extended Hubbard model\textemdash a simple example where such physics can be studied in detail, and discuss its relevance for the understanding of the phenomenology of low-density two-dimensional electron gases.},

In the last several years, the rapid development of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy revealed the presence of electromechanical hysteresis loops and bias-induced remnant polar states in a broad variety of materials including many inorganic oxides, polymers, and biosystems. In many cases, this behavior was interpreted as the ample evidence for ferroelectric nature of the system. Here, we systematically analyze PFM responses on ferroelectric and nonferroelectric materials and demonstrate that mechanisms unrelated to ferroelectricity can induce ferroelectric-like characteristics through charge injection and electrostatic forces on the tip. We will focus on similarities and differences in various PFM measurement characteristics to provide an experimental guideline to differentiate between ferroelectric material properties and charge injection. In the end, we apply the developed measurement protocols to an unknown ferroelectric material.},

The model is developed relying on the 1-D Poisson equation and the drift-diffusion transport mechanism. The validity of the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation is demonstrated in the limit to 0 K as a result of dopant freezeout in cryogenic equilibrium. Explicit MOS transistor expressions are then derived, including incomplete dopant ionization, bandgap widening, mobility reduction, and interface charge traps. The temperature dependence of the interface trapping process explains the discrepancy between the measured value of the subthreshold swing and the thermal limit at deep-cryogenic temperatures. The accuracy of the developed model is validated by experimental results on long devices of a commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS process. The proposed model provides the core expressions for the development of physically accurate compact models dedicated to low-temperature CMOS circuit simulation.},

Care should be taken because dopant freezeout results in a different physical definition of the threshold voltage. Using different definitions changes significantly the threshold current level. The proposed model is experimentally validated with measurements in large-area nMOS and pMOS devices of a commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS process down to 4.2 K.

Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO3 and both insulating and electron-doped ATiO3 perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO3 (which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO3 and LiOsO3 emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and this mechanism is `resistant' to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising avenues for further research.},

  abstract = {The resistance of two-dimensional electron systems such as thin disordered films shows deviations from Boltzmann theory, which are caused by quantum corrections and are called weak localization. The theoretical origin of weak localization is the Langer\textendash Neal graph in Kubo formalism. It represents an interference experiment with conduction electrons split into pairs of waves interfering in the back-scattering direction. The intensity of the interference (integrated over the time) can easily be measured by the resistance of the film. The application of a magnetic field B destroys the phase coherence after a time which is proportional to 1/B. For a field of 1 T this time is of the order of 1 ps. Therefore with a dc experiment, one can measure characteristic times of the electron system in the range of picoseconds. Weak localization has been applied to measure dephasing, spin-orbit scattering, tunneling times, etc. One important field of application is the investigation of magnetic systems and magnetic impurities by measuring the magnetic dephasing time and its temperature dependence. Here the Kondo maximum of spin-flip scattering, spin-fluctuations, Fermi liquid behavior and magnetic d-resonances have been investigated. Another field is the detection of magnetic moments for very dilute alloys and surface impurities.

While in the early prototyping as well as research and development phases, electrical test devices created by conventional lithography have provided adequate insights, this approach is becoming increasingly problematic due to complications such as irreversible damage to the original graphene film, contamination, and a high measurement effort per device. In this topical review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the issues that need to be addressed by any large-area characterisation method for electrical key performance indicators, with emphasis on electrical uniformity and on how this can be used to provide a more accurate analysis of the graphene film. We review and compare three different, but complementary approaches that rely either on fixed contacts (dry laser lithography), movable contacts (micro four point probes) and non-contact (terahertz time-domain spectroscopy) between the probe and the graphene film, all of which have been optimized for maximal throughput and accuracy, and minimal damage to the graphene film. Of these three, the main emphasis is on THz time-domain spectroscopy, which is non-destructive, highly accurate and allows both conductivity, carrier density and carrier mobility to be mapped across arbitrarily large areas at rates that by far exceed any other known method. We also detail how the THz conductivity spectra give insights on the scattering mechanisms, and through that, the microstructure of graphene films subject to different growth and transfer processes. The perspectives for upscaling to realistic production environments are discussed.},

  abstract = {The metal-insulator transition is one of the remarkable electrical properties of atomically thin molybdenum disulphide. Although the theory of electron\textendash electron interactions has been used in modelling the metal-insulator transition in molybdenum disulphide, the underlying mechanism and detailed transition process still remain largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that the vertical metal-insulator-semiconductor heterostructures built from atomically thin molybdenum disulphide are ideal capacitor structures for probing the electron states. The vertical configuration offers the added advantage of eliminating the influence of large impedance at the band tails and allows the observation of fully excited electron states near the surface of molybdenum disulphide over a wide excitation frequency and temperature range. By combining capacitance and transport measurements, we have observed a percolation-type metal-insulator transition, driven by density inhomogeneities of electron states, in monolayer and multilayer molybdenum disulphide. In addition, the valence band of thin molybdenum disulphide layers and their intrinsic properties are accessed.},

In this work, we present the photolithographic process and the plasma etching of arsenic tri-sulphide (As2S3) film. The films were deposited on thermally oxidized silicon substrates by ultra-fast pulsed laser deposition. To protect As2S3 film from photo-resist developer, thin resist layer {$\sim$}100\textendash 200nm was remained on the UV exposed area by controlling resist development time. After removing the protective layer in oxygen plasma, As2S3 waveguides were patterned in inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) system using CF4\textendash O2 gas mixture. We investigated the etch rate and the etch selectivity to photo-resist of As2S3 as a function of bias power, induction power, operating pressure, and gas flow rate ratio of CF4 and O2. The film is mainly etched by the chemical reaction with fluorine radicals. The content of oxygen in the plasma determines the etched sidewall profiles and nearly vertical profile was obtained at high oxygen content plasma.},

Fabricating planar As2S3 waveguides, however, is not straightforward because As2S3 is dissolved in alkalis such as photo-resist developer. In this study we present the application of thin SU-8 film as a protective layer to prevent the attack of the developer on the As2S3 during photolithographic process. Despite excellent coating feature and simple process of SU-8 as a protective layer, the delamination between SU-8 and polymer cladding during chip cleaving hindered its application. We deposited thin Al2O3 on SU-8 by atomic layer deposition and this intermediate layer could solve the problem. We measured the insertion losses of fabricated waveguides as a function of device lengths and widths. The propagation loss becomes significant in a narrow guide due to the enhanced surface scattering. It was clear that extra losses were engaged in long guides containing bending structures. SU-8 layer and thin Al2O3 combination allowed reliable and repeatable fabrication process in that it did not induce any extra light scattering or absorption and prevented attack of the As2S3 film by the alkaline developer. Moreover, the device characterisation revealed that SU-8 layer is superior to PMMA/BARC in terms of propagation loss of waveguide (\textcopyright{} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

Voltage-modulated atomic force microscopy (VM-AFM) has become a mainstay characterization tool for investigating these materials due to its ability to locally probe electromechanically responsive materials with spatial resolution from micrometers to nanometers. However, with the wide popularity of VM-AFM techniques such as piezoresponse force microscopy and electrochemical strain microscopy there has been a rise in reports of nanoscale electromechanical functionality, including hysteresis, in materials that should be incapable of exhibiting piezo- or ferroelectricity. Explanations for the origins of unexpected nanoscale phenomena have included new material properties, surface-mediated polarization changes, and/or spatially resolved behavior that is not present in bulk measurements. At the same time, it is well known that VM-AFM measurements are susceptible to numerous forms of crosstalk, and, despite efforts within the AFM community, a global approach for eliminating this has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a method for easily demonstrating the presence of hysteretic (i.e., ``false ferroelectric'') long-range interactions between the sample and cantilever body. This method should be easy to implement in any VM-AFM measurement. We then go on to demonstrate fully quantitative and repeatable nanoelectromechanical characterization using an interferometer. These quantitative measurements are critical for a wide range of devices including MEMS actuators and sensors, memristor, energy storage, and memory.},

Here we demonstrate a simple pulsed measurement technique which reduces this hysteretic behavior, enabling more accurate characterization of 2D transistors. We compare hysteresis and charge trapping in four types of devices fabricated from both exfoliated and synthetic MoS2, with SiO2 and HfO2 insulators, using DC and pulsed voltage measurements at different temperatures. Applying modest voltage pulses ( 1 ms) on the gate significantly reduces charge trapping and results in the elimination of over 80\% of hysteresis for all devices. At shorter pulse widths ( 1 \textmu s), up to 99\% of hysteresis is reduced for some devices. Our measurements enable the extraction of a unique value of field-effect mobility, regardless of voltage sweep direction, unlike measurements that rely on forward or backward DC measurements. This simple and reproducible technique is useful for studying the intrinsic properties of 2D transistors, and can be similarly applied to other nanoscale and emerging devices where charge trapping is of concern.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear optics is an essential component of modern laser systems and optoelectronic devices. It has also emerged as an important tool in probing the electronic, vibrational, magnetic, and crystallographic structure of materials ranging from oxides and metals, to polymers and biological samples. This review focuses on the specific technique of optical second harmonic generation (SHG), and its application in probing ferroelectric complex oxide crystals and thin films. As the dominant SHG interaction mechanism exists only in materials that lack inversion symmetry, SHG is a sensitive probe of broken inversion symmetry, and thus also of bulk polar phenomena in materials. By performing in-situ SHG polarimetry experiments in different experimental conditions such as sample orientation, applied electric field, and temperature, one can probe ferroelectric hysteresis loops and phase transitions. Careful modeling of the polarimetry data allows for the determination of the point group symmetry of the crystal. In epitaxial thin films with a two-dimensional arrangement of well-defined domain orientations, one can extract information about intrinsic material properties such as nonlinear coefficients, as well as microstructural information such as the local statistics of the different domain variants being probed. This review presents several detailed examples of ferroelectric systems where such measurements and modeling are performed. The use of SHG microscopic imaging is discussed, and its ability to reveal domain structures and phases not normally visible with linear optics is illustrated.},

This work presents results from in situ conductance measurements at thicknesses from sub-nm to around 250\,nm with parallel X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. An enhanced conductivity at low thickness is explained by the occurrence of Cu(II), which is segregated in the grain boundary and locally causes a conductivity similar to CuO, although the surface of the thick film has Cu2O stoichiometry. Since grains grow with an increasing film thickness, the effect of an apparent oxygen excess is most pronounced in vicinity to the substrate interface. Electrical properties of Cu2O grains are at least partially short-circuited by this effect. The study focuses on properties inherent to copper oxide, although interface effects cannot be ruled out. This non-destructive, bottom-up analysis reveals phenomena which are commonly not observable after device fabrication, but clearly dominate electrical properties of polycrystalline thin films.},

Due to its two dimensional nature, physical and chemical properties and ease of manipulation, graphene offers the possibility of integration with the existing semiconductor technology for next-generation electronic and sensing devices. In this context, the understanding of the graphene/semiconductor interface is of great importance since it can constitute a versatile standalone device as well as the building-block of more advanced electronic systems. Since graphene was brought to the attention of the scientific community in 2004, the device research has been focused on the more complex graphene transistors, while the graphene/semiconductor junction, despite its importance, has started to be the subject of systematic investigation only recently. As a result, a thorough understanding of the physics and the potentialities of this device is still missing. The studies of the past few years have demonstrated that graphene can form junctions with 3D or 2D semiconducting materials which have rectifying characteristics and behave as excellent Schottky diodes. The main novelty of these devices is the tunable Schottky barrier height, a feature which makes the graphene/semiconductor junction a great platform for the study of interface transport mechanisms as well as for applications in photo-detection, high-speed communications, solar cells, chemical and biological sensing, etc. In this paper, we review the state-of-the art of the research on graphene/semiconductor junctions, the attempts towards a modeling and the most promising applications.},

Using low temperature piezoresponse force microscopy, we revealed coexistence of piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric phases in CuInP2Se6, forming unusual domain walls with enhanced piezoelectric response. From systematic imaging experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries. The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and density-functional-theory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the existing phenomenology of functional domain walls. At the same time, phase-coexistence in chalcogenophosphates may lead to rational strategies for incorporation of ferroic functionality into van der Waals heterostructures, with stronger resilience toward detrimental size-effects.},

The voltage distributions along the M-S-M structure were numerically determined and found that the voltage drop across the reverse-biased Schottky barrier is dominating at the low bias voltage, and the dominant range depends on the value of the resistor of the semiconductor bulk. The field dependence of barrier height due to the image force was proposed to be the mechanism for the current through the M-S-M structure when the voltage drop across the reverse-biased barrier is dominating. The proposed model was applied to the I\textendash V curves measured at different temperatures on low-resistivity p-type CdTe with Au contacts and the density of the effective acceptors calculated, and the zero-field Schottky barrier height and the Richardson constant were extracted using the activation energy method.

These lead to an original regime of transport called transient localization, sharing features of both localized and itinerant electron systems. After a brief review of experimental observations that pose a challenge to the theory, we concentrate on a commonly studied model which describes the interaction of the charge carriers with intermolecular vibrations. We present different theoretical approaches that have been applied to the problem in the past, and then turn to more modern approaches that are able to capture the key microscopic phenomenon at the origin of the puzzling experimental observations, i.e., the quantum localization of the electronic wavefunction at timescales shorter than the typical molecular motions. We describe in particular a relaxation time approximation which clarifies how the transient localization due to dynamical molecular motions relates to the Anderson localization realized for static disorder, and allows us to devise strategies to improve the mobility of actual compounds. The relevance of the transient localization scenario to other classes of systems is briefly discussed.},

Recently, van der Waals ferroelectric In2Se3 with unique interlinked out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations has enabled multidirectional resistance switching, providing unprecedented flexibility in planar and vertical device integrations. However, the operating mechanisms of these devices have remained unclear. Here, through the demonstration of van der Waals In2Se3-based planar ferroelectric memristors with the device resistance continuously tunable over three orders of magnitude, and by correlating device resistance states, ferroelectric domain configurations, and surface electric potential, the studies reveal that the resistive switching is controlled by the multidomain formations and the associated energy barriers between domains, as opposed to the commonly assumed Schottky barrier modulations at the metal-ferroelectric interface. The findings reveal new device physics through elucidating the microscopic operating mechanisms of this new generation of devices, and provide a critical guide for future device development and integration efforts.},

However, separating ferroelectric effect from many of the factors (such as charge injection/trapping and the presence of mobile ions in the polymer) that confound interpretation is still confusing and controversial. This work presents a methodology to reliably identify the confounding factors which obscure the polarization effect in FeFETs. Careful observation of the Id?Vg curves, as well as monitoring the Id?Vg hysteresis and flat band voltage shift as a function of temperature and sweep frequency, identifies the dominant mechanism. This methodology is demonstrated by using 15 nm thick high glass transition temperature polar polymer-based FeFETs. In these devices, room temperature hysteresis is largely a consequence of charge trapping and mobile ions, while ferroelectric polarization is observed at elevated temperatures. This methodology can be used to unambiguously prove the effect of ferroelectric polarization in FeFETs.},

Without the limitation of a finite size effect, 2D materials with stable layered structures and reduced surface energy may go beyond the presence of an enhanced depolarization field in ultrathin ferroelectrics, thereby opening a pathway to explore low-dimensional ferroelectricity, making ultra-high-density devices possible and maintaining Moore's Law. Although many theoretical works on potential 2D ferroelectric materials have been conducted, much still needs to be accomplished experimentally, as it is rare for 2D ferroelectric materials to be proven and plenty of 2D ferroelectrics are waiting to be discovered. First, experimental and theoretical progress on 2D ferroelectric materials, including in-plane and out-of-plane, is reviewed, followed by a general introduction to various characterization methods. Intrinsic mechanisms associated with promising 2D ferroelectric materials, together with related applications, are also discussed. Finally, an outlook for future trends and development in 2D ferroelectricity are explored. Researchers can use this to obtain a basic understanding of 2D ferroelectric materials and to build a database of progress of 2D ferroelectrics.},

Regarding this significant issue, here we review the oxidation behaviors of 2D metal chalcogenides, especially for perfect and defective monolayers. Perfect monolayer metal chalcogenides are resistant to oxidation, resulting from the large activation energies for chemisorption and dissociation of O2 molecules during the reaction process. However, the defective monolayers with vacancies are prone to be oxidized with small activation energies. Interestingly, oxygen atoms can fill into the chalcogen vacancy sites and further maintian the electronic band structures of the perfect systems ? the band gaps and the carrier effective masses are only moderately modified by the oxygen atoms. These fundamental understandings help to improve the use of monolayer metal chalcogenides toward the development of novel 2D devices with high stability and excellent performance.},

  abstract = {The weak intermolecular interactions inherent in organic semiconductors make them susceptible to defect formation, resulting in localized states in the band-gap that can trap charge carriers at different timescales. Charge carrier trapping is thus ubiquitous in organic semiconductors and can have a profound impact on their performance when incorporated into optoelectronic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the phenomenon of charge carrier trapping in organic semiconductors, with emphasis on the underlying physical processes and its impact on device operation. We first define the concept of charge carrier trap, then outline and categorize different origins of traps. Next, we discuss their impact on the mechanism of charge transport and the performance of electronic devices. Progress in the filed in terms of characterization and detection of charge carrier traps is reviewed together with insights on future direction of research. Finally, a discussion on the exploitation of traps in memory and sensing applications is provided.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional material indium selenide (InSe) has offered a new platform for fundamental research in virtue of its emerging fascinating properties. Unlike 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), {$\epsilon$} phase InSe with a hexagonal unit cell possesses broken inversion symmetry in all the layer numbers, and predicted to have a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect. In this work, we find that the as-prepared pure InSe, alloyed InSe1\textendash xTex and InSe1\textendash xSx (x = 0.1 and 0.2) are {$\epsilon$} phase structures and exhibit excellent SHG performance from few-layer to bulk-like dimension. This high SHG efficiency is attributed to the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of the {$\epsilon$}-InSe system, which has been clearly verified by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The experimental results show that the SHG intensities from multilayer pure {$\epsilon$}-InSe and alloyed InSe0.9Te0.1 and InSe1\textendash xSx (x = 0.1 and 0.2) are around 1\textendash 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the monolayer TMD systems and even superior to that of GaSe with the same thickness. The estimated nonlinear susceptibility {$\chi$}(2) of {$\epsilon$}-InSe is larger than that of {$\epsilon$}-GaSe and monolayer TMDs. Our study provides first-hand information about the phase identification of {$\epsilon$}-InSe and indicates an excellent candidate for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications as well as the possibility of engineering SHG response by alloying.},

  abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of {$\sim$}4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

Because of this, response times in these devices often yield to slower, high gain processes, which cannot be turned off. Here we report on photodetectors incorporating the layered material In2Se3, which allow complete modulation of a high gain, photogating mechanism in the ON state in favor of fast photoconduction in the OFF state. While photoconduction is largely gate independent, photocurrent from the photogating effect is strongly modulated through application of a back gate voltage. By varying the back gate, we demonstrate control over the dominant mechanism responsible for photocurrent generation. Furthermore, because of the strong photogating effect, these direct-band gap, multilayer phototransistors produce ultrahigh gains of (9.8 {$\pm$} 2.5) \texttimes{} 104 A/W and inferred detectivities of (3.3 {$\pm$} 0.8) \texttimes{} 1013 Jones, putting In2Se3 among the most sensitive 2D materials for photodetection studied to date.},

  abstract = {The pace of two-dimensional materials (2DM) research has been greatly accelerated by the ability to identify exfoliated thicknesses down to a monolayer from their optical contrast. Since this process requires time-consuming and error-prone manual assignment to avoid false-positives from image features with similar contrast, efforts towards fast and reliable automated assignments schemes is essential. We show that by modelling the expected 2DM contrast in digitally captured images, we can automatically identify candidate regions of 2DM. More importantly, we show a computationally-light machine vision strategy for eliminating false-positives from this set of 2DM candidates through the combined use of binary thresholding, opening and closing filters, and shape-analysis from edge detection. Calculation of data pyramids for arbitrarily high-resolution optical coverage maps of two-dimensional materials produced in this way allows the real-time presentation and processing of this image data in a zoomable interface, enabling large datasets to be explored and analysed with ease. The result is that a standard optical microscope with CCD camera can be used as an analysis tool able to accurately determine the coverage, residue/contamination concentration, and layer number for a wide range of presented 2DMs.},

The dynamic FE model is applied to an FE-dielectric (FE-DE) series capacitor as well as FeFET after calibration and verification by transient measurement of an FE-HfO2 capacitor. By investigating current through the FE-DE series capacitor and the gate capacitor of FeFET, we find that incomplete screening of spontaneous polarization charge results in transient NC and sub-60 mV/dec SS. Also, it should be noted that, for FeFET, small depletion layer capacitance has an important role to cause strong depolarization effect and thus steep SS. Moreover, reverse drain induced barrier lowering happens even with this FE model. The model presented in this paper provides a reasonable interpretation for the previously reported steep SS of NC FETs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ferroelectric (FE) distortions in a metallic material were believed to be experimentally inaccessible because itinerant electrons would screen the long-range Coulomb interactions that favor a polar structure. It has been suggested by Anderson and Blount [P. W. Anderson, E. I. Blount, \emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} 14, 217-219 (1965)] that a transition from paraelectric phase to FE phase is possible for a metal if, in the paraelectric phase, the electrons at the Fermi level are decoupled from the soft transverse optical phonons, which lead to ferroelectricity. Here, using Raman spectroscopy combined with magnetotransport measurements on a recently discovered FE metal LiOsO\textsubscript{3}, we demonstrate active interplay of itinerant electrons and the FE order: Itinerant electrons cause strong renormalization of the FE order parameter, leading to a more gradual transition in LiOsO\textsubscript{3} than typical insulating FEs. In return, the FE order enhances the anisotropy of charge transport between parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction. The temperature-dependent evolution of Raman active in-plane \textsuperscript{3}E\textsubscript{g} phonon, which strongly couples to the polar-active out-of-the-plane A\textsubscript{2u} phonon mode in the high-temperature paraelectric state, exhibits a deviation in Raman shift from the expectation of the pseudospin-phonon model that is widely used to model many insulating FEs. The Curie-Weiss temperature (\texttheta{} {$\approx$} 97 K) obtained from the optical susceptibility is substantially lower than \emph{T}\textsubscript{s}, suggesting a strong suppression of FE fluctuations. Both line width and Fano line shape of \textsuperscript{3}E\textsubscript{g} Raman mode exhibit a strong electron-phonon coupling in the high-temperature paraelectric phase, which disappears in the FE phase, challenging Anderson/Blount's proposal for the formation of FE metals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The conducting PEDOT layers as source, drain, and gate electrodes were patterned by using photolithography. The poly(vinyl cinnamate) (PVCN) was spin coated and cross-linked as a gate insulator. The pentacene as an active layer was vapor deposited onto the PVCN layer. In order to compare the characteristics of the pentacene-based organic thin film transistor (OTFT) with PEDOT electrodes, we fabricated another pentacene-based OTFT using a Si-based pattern with Au electrodes. The electrical characteristics of the devices, such as charge carrier mobility  ({$\mu$}) ({$\mu$}) , threshold voltage  ( V th ) (Vth) , and on/off current ratio  ( I on/off ) (Ion/off) , were measured from its current-voltage  (I-V) (I-V)  characteristic curves.

This energy was larger than that of the OTFT with Au electrodes which was measured to be  {$\sim$}0.13eV {$\sim$}0.13eV . However, the  {$\mu$} {$\mu$} 's of both OTFTs were almost the same, in spite of the relatively lower electrical conductivity of the PEDOT and the larger  E a Ea  of the OTFT with the PEDOT electrodes. From the results of temperature dependence of current density based on the Schottky emission model, we analyze that the lower barrier height between the PEDOT electrode and the pentacene active layer resulted in easier charge injection from the PEDOT electrode into the active layer.},

  abstract = {An unexpected superconductivity enhancement is reported in decompressed In2Se3. The onset of superconductivity in In2Se3 occurs at 41.3 GPa with a critical temperature (Tc) of 3.7 K, peaking at 47.1 GPa. The striking observation shows that this layered chalcogenide remains superconducting in decompression down to 10.7 GPa. More surprisingly, the highest Tc that occurs at lower decompression pressures is 8.2 K, a twofold increase in the same crystal structure as in compression. It is found that the evolution of Tc is driven by the pressure-induced R-3m to I-43d structural transition and significant softening of phonons and gentle variation of carrier concentration combined in the pressure quench. The novel decompression-induced superconductivity enhancement implies that it is possible to maintain pressure-induced superconductivity at lower or even ambient pressures with better superconducting performance.},

  abstract = {The discovery of ferroelectricity in oxides that are compatible with modern semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as hafnium oxide, has led to a re-emergence of the ferroelectric field-effect transistor in advanced microelectronics. A ferroelectric field-effect transistor combines a ferroelectric material with a semiconductor in a transistor structure. In doing so, it merges logic and memory functionalities at the single-device level, delivering some of the most pressing hardware-level demands for emerging computing paradigms. Here, we examine the potential of the ferroelectric field-effect transistor technologies in current embedded non-volatile memory applications and future in-memory, biomimetic and alternative computing models. We highlight the material- and device-level challenges involved in high-volume manufacturing in advanced technology nodes ({$\leq$}10 nm), which are reminiscent of those encountered in the early days of high-K-metal-gate transistor development. We argue that the ferroelectric field-effect transistors can be a key hardware component in the future of computing, providing a new approach to electronics that we term ferroelectronics.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors commonly comprise nanotubes lying on SiO2 surfaces exposed to the ambient environment. It is shown here that the transistors exhibit hysteresis in their electrical characteristics because of charge trapping by water molecules around the nanotubes, including SiO2 surface-bound water proximal to the nanotubes. Hysteresis persists for the transistors in vacuum since the SiO2-bound water does not completely desorb in vacuum at room temperature, a known phenomenon in SiO2 surface chemistry. Heating under dry conditions significantly removes water and reduces hysteresis in the transistors. Nearly hysteresis-free transistors are obtainable by passivating the devices with polymers that hydrogen bond with silanol groups on SiO2 (e.g., with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)). However, nanotube humidity sensors could be explored with suitable water-sensitive coatings. The results may have implications to field-effect transistors made from other chemically derived materials.},

Here, we report that boron atoms can be efficiently substituted for carbon in graphene. Single-layer graphene substitutionally doped with boron was prepared by the mechanical exfoliation of boron-doped graphite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the amount of substitutional boron in graphite was {$\sim$}0.22 atom \%. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the boron atoms were spaced 4.76 nm apart in single-layer graphene. The 7-fold higher intensity of the D-band when compared to the G-band was explained by the elastically scattered photoexcited electrons by boron atoms before emitting a phonon. The frequency of the G-band in single-layer substitutionally boron-doped graphene was unchanged, which could be explained by the p-type boron doping (stiffening) counteracting the tensile strain effect of the larger carbon\textendash boron bond length (softening). Boron-doped graphene appears to be a useful tool for engineering the physical and chemical properties of graphene.},

In order to clarify the mechanism of the asymmetrical hysteresis phenomena observed in the transfer characteristics of the MoS2 and WSe2 FET, the temperature dependencies of their characteristics are analyzed. Based on these analyses, it can be concluded that donor-like traps present in both the SiO2/MoS2 interface and the MoS2 bulk in multi-layered MoS2 FETs, and that acceptor-like traps present in both the SiO2/WSe2 interface, and the WSe2 bulk in multi-layered WSe2 FETs. Furthermore, based on the chemical analyses and the arguments presented in previous studies, we propose that the sulfur vacancy (SV) is the origin of donor-like traps present in MoS2, and the tungsten vacancy (TV) is the origin of acceptor-like traps present in WSe2. This work may provide a potential clue to overcome many practical problems for realization of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based FETs.},

  abstract = {We present the concept of ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). These junctions consist of two metal electrodes separated by a nanometer-thick ferroelectric barrier. The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed under the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant conduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect inherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The calculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the current-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier thickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge. Remarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to the piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place after the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze the influence of an internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening of polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for asymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable change of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the symmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that characteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from one to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of FTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and depolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar top and bottom electrodes are preferable for the nonvolatile memory applications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.},

For improved performance in organic photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, and field-effect transistors (FETs), efficient transport of the charge carriers within the organic semiconductor is especially critical. Characterization of charge transport in these organic semiconductors is important both from scientific and technological perspectives. In this review, we shall mainly discuss the techniques for measuring the charge carrier mobility and not the theoretical underpinnings of the mechanism of charge transport. Mobility measurements in organic semiconductors and particularly in conjugated polymers, using space-charge-limited current, time of flight, carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage, double injection, FETs, and impedance spectroscopy are discussed. The relative merits, as well as limitations for each of these techniques are reviewed. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys, 2012},

Here, we investigated thoroughly the gate bias stress and hysteresis effects in InAs nanowire FETs. It is observed that the output current decreases together with the threshold voltage shifting to the positive direction when a positive gate bias stress is applied, and vice versa for the negative gate bias stress. For double-sweep transfer characteristics, the significant hysteresis behavior is observed, depending heavily on the sweeping rate and range. On the basis of complementary investigations of these devices, charge traps are confirmed to be the dominant factor for these instability effects. Importantly, the hysteresis can be simulated well by utilizing a combination of the rate equation for electron density and the empirical model for electron mobility. This provides an accurate evaluation of carrier mobility, which is in distinct contrast to the overestimation of mobility when using the transconductance for calculation. All these findings are important for understanding the charge trap dynamics to further enhance the device performance of nanowire FETs.},

A strong photoresponse was observed in both unipolar MoS2 and ambipolar WSe2 FETs (i) at the high drain voltage due to a high electric field along the channel for separating photo-excited charge carriers and (ii) at the certain gate voltage due to the optimized barriers for the collection of photo-excited charge carriers at metal contacts. The effective barrier height between Ti/Au and TMDCs was estimated by a low temperature measurement. An ohmic contact behavior and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) were clearly observed in MoS2 FET. In contrast, a Schottky-to-ohmic contact transition was observed in WSe2 FET as the gate voltage increases, due to the change of majority carrier transport from holes to electrons. The gate-dependent barrier modulation effectively controls the carrier transport, demonstrating its great potential in 2D TMDCs for electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

Here we report density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the Born-Szigeti theory of pyroelectricity, by combining fundamental thermodynamics and the modern theory of polarization. We find satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the case of bulk benchmark materials, showing that the so-called electron-phonon renormalization, whose contribution has been traditionally viewed as negligible, is important. We predict out-of-plane pyroelectricity in the recently synthesized Janus MoSSe monolayer and in-plane pyroelectricity in the group-IV monochalcogenide GeS monolayer. It is notable that the so-called secondary pyroelectricity is found to be dominant in GeS monolayer. The present work opens a theoretical route to study the pyroelectric effect using DFT and provides a valuable tool in the search for new candidates for pyroelectric applications.},

Here, we report on the observation of quasi-2D transport and WAL effect in sublimed-salt-assisted low-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown few-layered high-quality VSe2 nanosheets.

In contrast to 300 K, the cryogenic drain saturation current (Idsat) gain significantly enhances from 54\% to 167\% with the increasing channel length and has a relatively weak response to width change. In addition, the degraded subthreshold swing (SS) due to the short channel effect is alleviated at lower temperatures. The merits of a typical nMOS transistor (W/L = 0.6 {$\mu$}m/60 nm) worked at 4.2 K are associated with an improved Idsat ( 1.3 times), decreased drain leakage current with three orders of magnitude, and 2/3 reduced SS. However, the cryogenic Idsat tends to saturate below 10 K and the threshold voltage increases, as well as barrier lowering induced by drain voltage, starts to deteriorate. The detailed analyses on these MOSFET (deep) cryogenic characteristics are implemented based on the comprehensive semiconductor physics images, including energy band change, temperature/geometry-dependent scattering, band-to-band tunneling process, and depletion width influence. Our findings will be beneficial for the community to design ultralow temperature-integrated circuits.},

When a voltage is applied to this ferroelectric capacitor, a clear transition from an insulator to a metal and vice versa is observed in the transistor. Importantly, when the biased voltage is turned off, the remnant polarization in the ferroelectric can keep the MoS2 in its original phase, thereby providing a non-volatile state.

The SHG technique is sufficiently sensitive at the atomic scale and therefore suitable for studies on 2D materials. More importantly, it has the capacity to acquire abundant information ranging from crystallographic, and electronic, to magnetic properties in various 2D materials due to its sensitivity to both spatial-inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. These advantages accompanied by its characteristics of non-invasion and high throughput make SHG a powerful tool for 2D materials. This review summarizes recent experimental developments of SHG applications in 2D materials and also provides an outlook of potential prospects based on SHG.},

On the other hand, the EC effect estimated by the conventional hysteresis loop measurement showed different peaking temperature from the theoretical prediction.

We demonstrate that the introduction of hydrogen to the argon carrier gas dramatically improves the optical quality and increases the growth area of WS2, resulting in films exhibiting mm2 coverage. The addition of hydrogen more effectively reduces the WO3 precursor and protects against oxidative etching of the synthesized monolayers. The stoichiometric WS2 monolayers synthesized using Ar\,+\,H2 carrier gas exhibit superior optical characteristics, with photoluminescence emission full width half maximum (FWHM) values below 40\,meV and emission intensities nearly an order of magnitude higher than films synthesized in a pure Ar environment.},

Here, based upon that model, a two-species-percolation scaling theory is introduced and compared to the experimental data. It is shown that many features of the experiments, such as the exponential dependence of the resistance on temperature on the metallic side, the linear dependence of the exponent on density, the e2/h scale of the critical resistance, the quenching of the metallic phase by a parallel magnetic field and the non-monotonic dependence of the critical density on a perpendicular magnetic field, can be naturally explained by the model. Moreover, details such as the non-monotonic dependence of the resistance on temperature or the inflection point of the resistance vs. parallel magnetic field are also a natural consequence of the theory. The calculated parallel field dependence of the critical density agrees excellently with experiments, and is used to deduce an experimental value of the confining energy in the vertical direction.},

Percolation transport at low source\textendash drain voltage is governed by inhomogeneously distributed potential in strongly interacting monolayer MoS2 with a substrate, distinct from the quantum phase transition in multilayer MoS2. At a high source\textendash drain voltage regime, the insulating phase is transformed further to a metallic phase, exhibiting multiphases of metallic\textendash insulating\textendash metallic transitions in monolayer MoS2. These behaviors highlight MoS2 as a model system to study various classical and quantum transports as well as metal\textendash insulator transition in two-dimensional systems.},

  abstract = {Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a powerful characterization technique to readily image and manipulate the ferroelectric domains. PFM gives an insight into the strength of local piezoelectric coupling and polarization direction through PFM amplitude and phase, respectively. Converting measured arbitrary units into units of effective piezoelectric constant remains a challenge, and insufficient methods are often used. While most quantification efforts have been spent on quantifying the PFM amplitude signal, little attention has been given to the PFM phase, which is often arbitrarily adjusted to fit expectations. This is problematic when investigating materials with unknown or negative sign of the probed effective electrostrictive coefficient or strong frequency dispersion of electromechanical responses, because assumptions about the PFM phase cannot be reliably made. The PFM phase can, however, provide important information on the polarization orientation and the sign of the effective electrostrictive coefficient probed by PFM. Most notably, the orientation of the PFM hysteresis loop is determined by the PFM phase. Moreover, when presenting PFM data as a combined signal, the resulting response can be artificially lowered or asymmetric if the phase data have not been correctly processed. Here, we explain the PFM amplitude quantification process and demonstrate a path to identify the phase offset required to extract correct meaning from the PFM phase data. We explore different sources of phase offsets including the experimental setup, instrumental contributions, and data analysis. We discuss the physical working principles of PFM and develop a strategy to extract physical meaning from the PFM amplitude and phase.},

  abstract = {Electron transport in semiconducting polymers is usually inferior to hole transport, which is ascribed to charge trapping on isolated defect sites situated within the energy bandgap. However, a general understanding of the origin of these omnipresent charge traps, as well as their energetic position, distribution and concentration, is lacking. Here we investigate electron transport in a wide range of semiconducting polymers by current\textendash voltage measurements of single-carrier devices. We observe for this materials class that electron transport is limited by traps that exhibit a Gaussian energy distribution in the bandgap. Remarkably, the electron-trap distribution is identical for all polymers considered: the number of traps amounts to 3 \texttimes{} 1023\,traps\,per~m3 centred at an energy of \textasciitilde 3.6\,eV below the vacuum level, with a typical distribution width of \textasciitilde 0.1\,eV. This indicates that the electron traps have a common origin that, we suggest, is most likely related to hydrated oxygen complexes. A consequence of this finding is that the trap-limited electron current can be predicted for any polymer.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDMaterials by design is an appealing idea that is very hard to realize in practice. Combining the best of different ingredients in one ultimate material is a task for which we currently have no general solution. However, we do have some successful examples to draw upon: Composite materials and III-V heterostructures have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. Still, we need a general strategy to solve the problem of mixing and matching crystals with different properties, creating combinations with predetermined attributes and functionalities. ADVANCESTwo-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform that allows creation of heterostructures with a variety of properties. One-atom-thick crystals now comprise a large family of these materials, collectively covering a very broad range of properties. The first material to be included was graphene, a zero-overlap semimetal. The family of 2D crystals has grown to includes metals (e.g., NbSe2), semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), and insulators [e.g., hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)]. Many of these materials are stable at ambient conditions, and we have come up with strategies for handling those that are not. Surprisingly, the properties of such 2D materials are often very different from those of their 3D counterparts. Furthermore, even the study of familiar phenomena (like superconductivity or ferromagnetism) in the 2D case, where there is no long-range order, raises many thought-provoking questions.A plethora of opportunities appear when we start to combine several 2D crystals in one vertical stack. Held together by van der Waals forces (the same forces that hold layered materials together), such heterostructures allow a far greater number of combinations than any traditional growth method. As the family of 2D crystals is expanding day by day, so too is the complexity of the heterostructures that could be created with atomic precision.When stacking different crystals together, the synergetic effects become very important. In the first-order approximation, charge redistribution might occur between the neighboring (and even more distant) crystals in the stack. Neighboring crystals can also induce structural changes in each other. Furthermore, such changes can be controlled by adjusting the relative orientation between the individual elements.Such heterostructures have already led to the observation of numerous exciting physical phenomena. Thus, spectrum reconstruction in graphene interacting with hBN allowed several groups to study the Hofstadter butterfly effect and topological currents in such a system. The possibility of positioning crystals in very close (but controlled) proximity to one another allows for the study of tunneling and drag effects. The use of semiconducting monolayers leads to the creation of optically active heterostructures.The extended range of functionalities of such heterostructures yields a range of possible applications. Now the highest-mobility graphene transistors are achieved by encapsulating graphene with hBN. Photovoltaic and light-emitting devices have been demonstrated by combining optically active semiconducting layers and graphene as transparent electrodes. OUTLOOKCurrently, most 2D heterostructures are composed by direct stacking of individual monolayer flakes of different materials. Although this method allows ultimate flexibility, it is slow and cumbersome. Thus, techniques involving transfer of large-area crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), direct growth of heterostructures by CVD or physical epitaxy, or one-step growth in solution are being developed. Currently, we are at the same level as we were with graphene 10 years ago: plenty of interesting science and unclear prospects for mass production. Given the fast progress of graphene technology over the past few years, we can expect similar advances in the production of the heterostructures, making the science and applications more achievable. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6298/aac9439/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Production of van der Waals heterostructures.Owing to a large number of 2D crystals available today, many functional van der Waals heterostructures can be created. What started with mechanically assembled stacks (top) has now evolved to large-scale growth by CVD or physical epitaxy (bottom). The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices\textemdash such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes\textemdash are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.},

This can lead to an apparent difference in the defect characteristics in ferroelectric-HfO2 compared to the paraelectric-HfO2 structures they are shown to closely resemble when this contribution is decoupled.

In this work, the linear and nonlinear optical susceptibility of LiOsO3 is studied by means of ellipsometry and optical second harmonic generation (SHG). Strong optical birefringence is observed using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The nonlinear optical susceptibility extracted from SHG polarimetry reveals that the tensor components are of the same magnitude as in the isostructural insulator LiNbO3, except the component along the polar axis d33 is suppressed by an order of magnitude. Temperature-dependent SHG measurements in combination with Raman spectroscopy indicate a continuous order-disorder type polar phase transition at 140\,K. Linear and nonlinear optical microscopy measurements reveal 109\textdegree/71\textdegree{} ferroelastic domain walls, like in other trigonal ferroelectrics.

This transistor-type ferroelectric memory has interesting fundamental device physics and potentially large industrial impact. Among various applications of ferroelectric thin films, the development of nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) has been most actively progressed since the late 1980s and reached modest mass production for specific application since 1995. There are two types of memory cells in ferroelectric nonvolatile memories. One is the capacitor-type FeRAM and the other is the field-effect transistor (FET)-type FeRAM. Although the FET-type FeRAM claims the ultimate scalability and nondestructive readout characteristics, the capacitor-type FeRAMs have been the main interest for the major semiconductor memory companies, because the ferroelectric FET has fatal handicaps of cross-talk for random accessibility and short retention time. This book aims to provide the readers with development history, technical issues, fabrication methodologies, and promising applications of FET-type ferroelectric memory devices, presenting a comprehensive review of past, present, and future technologies. The topics discussed will lead to further advances in large-area electronics implemented on glass, plastic or paper substrates as well as in conventional Si electronics.

In this work, their effects on mobility degradation at low temperature and hysteresis at high temperature are investigated by characterizing electrical properties of the device in a temperature range of 20\textendash 300 K. As acceptor-like traps at the interface are frozen below 230 K, the hysteresis becomes negligible but simultaneously the channel mobility significantly degrades because the inactive neutral traps allow additional collisions of electrons at the interface. This is confirmed by the fact that a gate bias adversely affects the channel mobility. An activation energy of such traps is estimated as 170 meV. The activated trap charges' trapping and de-trapping processes in response to the gate pulse bias reveal that the time constants for the slow and fast processes decrease due to additionally activated traps as the temperature increases.},

  abstract = {The existence of an exquisite phenomenon such as a metal\textendash insulator transition (MIT) in two-dimensional (2D) systems, where completely different electronic functionalities in the same system can emerge simply by regulating parameters such as charge carrier density in them, is noteworthy. Such tunability in material properties can lead to several applications where precise tuning of function specific properties are desirable. Here, we report on our observation on the occurrence of MIT in the 2D material system of copper indium selenide (CuIn7Se11). Clear evidence of the metallic nature of conductivity ({$\sigma$}) under the influence of electrostatic doping via the gate, which crosses over to an insulating phase upon lowering the temperature, was observed by investigating the temperature and gate dependence of {$\sigma$} in CuIn7Se11 field-effect transistor devices. At higher charge carrier densities (n {$>$} 1012 cm\textendash 1), we found that {$\sigma$} {$\sim$} (n){$\alpha$} with {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 2, which suggests the presence of bare Coulomb impurity scattering within the studied range of temperature (280 K {$>$} T {$>$} 20 K). Our analysis of the conductivity data following the principles of percolation theory of transition where {$\sigma$} {$\sim$} (n - nC){$\delta$} show that the critical percolation exponent {$\delta$}(T) has average values {$\sim$}1.57 {$\pm$} 0.27 and 1.02 {$\pm$} 0.35 within the measured temperature range for the two devices and it is close to the 2D percolation exponent value of 1.33. We believe that the 2D MIT seen in our system is due to the charge density inhomogeneity caused by electrostatic doping and unscreened charge impurity scattering that leads to a percolation driven transition. The findings reported here for CuIn7Se11 system provide a different material platform to investigate MIT in 2D and are crucial in order to understand the fundamental basis of electronic interactions and charge-transport phenomenon in other unexplored 2D electron systems.},

  abstract = {A ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) that may potentially integrate the data storage and logic functions in the same circuitry can also be used as a platform to study the properties of the ferroelectric material itself. Thin crystals of \{\textbackslash alpha\}-In2Se3, a ferroelectric transition metal chalcogenide semiconductor featuring van de Waals interlayer coupling and an energy gap of around 1.4 eV, was used in this work as the channel material as opposed to the gate dielectric of the FeFET. These FeFETs, which feature a back gate of heavily doped Si and a gate dielectric of 300 nm thick thermally grown SiO2, were measured down to liquid helium temperatures. They were found to show good electric field effect functions and electric field effect induced metallic behavior, along with possible signs for the existence of polarization domains.},

The uniformity of the contact resistance for gold, tungsten, and SrRuO3 electrodes on polycrystalline ternary Bi2Te3-based alloys for different types of surface cleaning procedures was characterized. The presence of a nanometer-thick native oxide layer on the Bi2Te3 surface leads to large and non-uniform contact resistance. Surface treatments included solvent cleans and chemical and dry etching prior to metallization of the Bi2Te3. Only etching the surface led to a significant improvement in contact resistance uniformity. None of the tested contacts reacted with the underlying Bi2Te3 substrate. Etching resulted in the removal of the native oxide on the Bi2Te3 surface, which was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The average thickness, chemistry, and dry etch rate of the native oxide was further characterized using XPS. The non-uniformity in contact resistance suggests that the native oxide grows non-uniformly on polycrystalline bismuth telluride surfaces.},

Electrically switchable intrinsic electric polarization, together with the direct observation of ferroelectric domains, has not yet been realized in a bulk crystalline metal, although incomplete screening by mobile conduction charges should, in principle, be possible. Here, we provide evidence that native metallicity and ferroelectricity coexist in bulk crystalline van der Waals WTe2 by means of electrical transport, nanoscale piezoresponse measurements, and first-principles calculations. We show that, despite being a Weyl semimetal, WTe2 has switchable spontaneous polarization and a natural ferroelectric domain structure at room temperature. This new class of materials has tantalizing potential for functional nanoelectronics applications. WTe2, a layered crystalline material, displays both ferroelectricity and metallicity.

  abstract = {Ferroelectric tunnel junctions, in which ferroelectric polarization and quantum tunneling are closely coupled to induce the tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect, have attracted considerable interest due to their potential in nonvolatile and low-power consumption memory devices. The ferroelectric size effect, however, has hindered ferroelectric tunnel junctions from exhibiting a robust TER effect. Here, our study proposes doping engineering in a two-dimensional in-plane ferroelectric semiconductor as an effective strategy to design a two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction composed of homostructural p-type semiconductor/ferroelectric/n-type semiconductor. Because the in-plane polarization persists in the monolayer ferroelectric barrier, the vertical thickness of two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction can be as thin as a monolayer. We show that the monolayer In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe junction provides an embodiment of this strategy. Combining density functional theory calculations with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we investigate the electron transport properties of In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe and reveal a giant TER effect of 1460\%. The dynamical modulation of both barrier width and barrier height during the ferroelectric switching is responsible for this giant TER effect. These findings provide an important insight into the understanding of the quantum behaviors of electrons in materials at the two-dimensional limit and enable new possibilities for next-generation nonvolatile memory devices based on flexible two-dimensional lateral ferroelectric tunnel junctions.},

  abstract = {Incorporation of two-dimensional (2D) materials in electronic devices inevitably involves contact with metals, and the nature of this contact (Ohmic and/or Schottky) can dramatically affect the electronic properties of the assembly. Controlling these properties to reliably form low-resistance Ohmic contact remains a great challenge due to the strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect at the interface. Herein, we employ density functional theory calculations to show that van der Waals stacking can significantly modulate Schottky barrier heights in the contact formed between multilayer InSe and 2D metals by suppressing the FLP effect. Importantly, the increase of InSe layer number induces a transition from Schottky to Ohmic contact, which is attributed to the decrease of the conduction band minimum and rise of the valence band maximum of InSe. Based on the computed tunneling and Schottky barriers, Cd3C2 is the most compatible electrode for 2D InSe among the materials studied. This work illustrates a straightforward method for developing more effective InSe-based 2D electronic nanodevices.},

The symmetry breaking is captured by the order parameter known as spontaneous polarization, whose switching under an external electric field results in a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop. In addition, the responses of spontaneous polarization to other external excitations are related to a number of physical effects such as second-harmonic generation, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and dielectric properties. Based on these, this review summarizes recent developments in molecular ferroelectrics since 2011 and focuses on the relationship between symmetry breaking and ferroelectricity, offering ideas for exploring high-performance molecular ferroelectrics.},

Further, we show how hysteresis and leakage are affected by doping, film thickness, electrode work function, ambient temperature, and loading frequency.},

We have performed high-pressure Raman spectroscopy studies on RbHSO4 up to a maximum pressure of 5.15 GPa and at ambient temperature to understand the microscopic origin and mechanism of ferroelectric transition. On the basis of the pressure dependence of Raman mode frequencies and their full-width at half-maxima, we observed a transition around a pressure of 0.3 GPa, similar to the ferroelectric transition discovered in dielectric measurements, followed by another transition around 2.4 GPa. These phase transitions are evident from the appearance/disappearance of Raman-active modes and the change in the slope of frequencies with pressures. From the pressure dependence of the S\textendash O and S\textendash OH frequencies, we deduce that HSO4\textendash{} ion ordering results in ferroelectric phase transition around 0.3 GPa. Further, the transition around 2.4 GPa pressure is associated with significant changes in the stretching and bending vibrational frequencies and indicates a structural phase transition with possible lowering of the crystal symmetry. Interestingly, no significant changes are observed in the Raman spectrum around 1 GPa, at which a phase transition was noticed in earlier X-ray and dielectric studies.},

Polar metals, however, defy this rule and have thus attracted considerable attention as a new class of ferroelectrics exhibiting novel properties. Here, we fabricate a new polar metal film based on the typical ferroelectric material BaTiO3by combining chemical doping and epitaxial strain induced by a substrate. The temperature dependences of the c-axis lattice constant and the second harmonic generation intensity of La-doped BaTiO3films indicate the existence of polar transitions. In addition, through La doping, films become metallic at the polar phase, and metallicity enhancement at the polar state occurs in low-La-doped films. This intriguing behaviour is effectively explained by our first-principles calculations. Our demonstration suggests that the carrier doping to ferroelectric material with epitaxial strain serves as a new way to explore polar metals.},

BaTi2O5 is regarded as a homogeneous system, and the lattice dynamics can be interpreted by the selection rules and tensor properties of the homogeneous structure. Angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy clearly shows that an A-mode-type overdamped phonon plays the key role in the phase transition. Using a combination of experimental results and first-principles calculations, we explain the phase transition as follows: In one of three TiO6 octahedral units, Ti vibrates along the b axis opposite an oxygen octahedral unit with large damping in the paraelectric phase, whereas this vibration is frozen in the ferroelectric phase, leading to a change in the space group from nonpolar C2/m to polar C2.},

Important concepts and principles in physics and chemistry that govern the formation of the SBH are described in detail, from which the experimental and theoretical results for individual MS interfaces can be understood.

In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time- and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a single-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize [``The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016,'' http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel\_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ (Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also resulted in a growing number of reports on the nearly ubiquitous presence of ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in the bulk or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric-like responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible mechanisms behind observed behaviors and possible experimental strategies for their identification.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent developments on the fabrication and control of semiconductor-based quantum dots, we theoretically study a finite system of tunnel-coupled quantum dots with the electrons interacting through the long-range Coulomb interaction. When the interelectron separation is large and the quantum dot confinement potential is weak, the system behaves as an effective Wigner crystal with a period determined by the electron average density with considerable electron hopping throughout the system. For stronger periodic confinement potentials, however, the system makes a crossover to a Mott-type ground state where the electrons are completely localized at the individual dots with little interdot tunneling. In between these two phases, the system is essentially a strongly correlated electron liquid with intersite electron hopping constrained by strong Coulomb interaction. We characterize this Wigner-Mott-liquid quantum crossover with detailed numerical finite-size diagonalization calculations of the coupled interacting quantum dot system, showing that these phases can be smoothly connected by tuning the system parameters. Experimental feasibility of observing such a hopping-tuned Wigner-Mott-liquid crossover in currently available semiconductor quantum dots is discussed. In particular, we connect our theoretical results to recent quantum-dot-based quantum emulation experiments where a collective Coulomb blockade was demonstrated. We discuss realistic disorder effects on our theoretical findings. One conclusion of our work is that experiments must explore lower density quantum dot arrays in order to clearly observe the Wigner phase although the Mott-liquid crossover phenomenon should already manifest itself in the currently available quantum dot arrays. We also suggest a direct experimental electron density probe, such as atomic force microscopy or scanning tunneling microscopy, for a clear observation of the effective Wigner crystal phase.},

In addition to trapping and release of charges, other scattering mechanisms that influence mobility are considered along with screening by free carriers. The mobility for each of the dominant scattering mechanisms is calculated using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in the relaxation time approximation. It is found that trapped carriers very effectively scatter the charges that move in extended states. This type of scattering is unique to TFTs. Experimental data from high-mobility amorphous metal oxide TFTs are compared with calculations with very good agreement. At high temperatures, scattering by longitudinal optical phonons and surface phonons becomes significant. This work represents the first successful combination of charge carrier scattering and the BTE with thermally activated MTR transport in a disordered semiconductor. Charge transport in amorphous metal oxide transistors is quantitatively described for the first time and the factors that influence the mobility at various temperatures and charge carrier densities are clearly described. This approach can be used for describing transport in several amorphous and polycrystalline semiconductors with significant disorder and trapping.},

Charge carriers can be significantly localized due to strong scattering, altering the model of band transport in extended states so that, effectively, only a fraction of carriers can actually move in the extended states, in accordance with a statistical distribution of free paths. It is necessary to explicitly consider this effect in applying conventional semiconductor transport theories based on solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). We are then able to apply the BTE with appropriate scattering mechanisms and obtain results that agree well with experiment for the case of a polymer thin-film transistor (TFT). This approach is very well suited to thin-film transistors based on polymer and organic semiconductors, and also many amorphous oxide semiconductors with room temperature mobilities in the range 1\textendash 20 cm2/(Vs).},

While an ideal, non-interacting 2D system of infinite size is always localised, the localisation length-scale may be too large to be unambiguously observed in an experiment. In this sense, 2D is a marginal dimension between one-dimension, where all states are strongly localised, and three-dimensions, where a well-defined phase transition between localisation and delocalisation exists as the energy is increased. Here, we report the results of an experiment measuring the 2D transport of ultracold atoms between two reservoirs, which are connected by a channel containing pointlike disorder. The design overcomes many of the technical challenges that have hampered observation of localisation in previous works. We experimentally observe exponential localisation in a 2D ultracold atom system.},

  abstract = {Wide band gap semiconductors are essential for today's electronic devices and energy applications because of their high optical transparency, controllable carrier concentration, and tunable electrical conductivity. The most intensively investigated wide band gap semiconductors are transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), such as tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) and amorphous In\textendash Ga\textendash Zn\textendash O (IGZO), used in displays and solar cells, carbides (e.g., SiC) and nitrides (e.g., GaN) used in power electronics, and emerging halides (e.g., {$\gamma$}-CuI) and 2D electronic materials (e.g., graphene) used in various optoelectronic devices. Compared to these prominent materials families, chalcogen-based (Ch = S, Se, Te) wide band gap semiconductors are less heavily investigated but stand out because of their propensity for p-type doping, high mobilities, high valence band positions (i.e., low ionization potentials), and broad applications in electronic devices such as CdTe solar cells. This manuscript provides a review of wide band gap chalcogenide semiconductors. First, we outline general materials design parameters of high performing transparent semiconductors, as well as the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of the corresponding research methods. We proceed to summarize progress in wide band gap (EG {$>$} 2 eV) chalcogenide materials\textemdash namely, II\textendash VI MCh binaries, CuMCh2 chalcopyrites, Cu3MCh4 sulvanites, mixed-anion layered CuMCh(O,F), and 2D materials\textemdash and discuss computational predictions of potential new candidates in this family, highlighting their optical and electrical properties. We finally review applications\textemdash for example, photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical solar cells, transistors, and light emitting diodes\textemdash that employ wide band gap chalcogenides as either an active or passive layer. By examining, categorizing, and discussing prospective directions in wide band gap chalcogenides, this Review aims to inspire continued research on this emerging class of transparent semiconductors and thereby enable future innovations for optoelectronic devices.},

However, depolarizing electrostatic fields and interfacial chemical bonds can destroy this long-range polar order at two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here we report the experimental discovery of the locking between out-of-plane dipoles and in-plane lattice asymmetry in atomically thin In2Se3 crystals, a new stabilization mechanism leading to our observation of intrinsic 2D out-of-plane ferroelectricity. Through second harmonic generation spectroscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy, we found switching of out-of-plane electric polarization requires a flip of nonlinear optical polarization that corresponds to the inversion of in-plane lattice orientation. The polar order shows a very high transition temperature ({$\sim$}700 K) without the assistance of extrinsic screening. This finding of intrinsic 2D ferroelectricity resulting from dipole locking opens up possibilities to explore 2D multiferroic physics and develop ultrahigh density memory devices.},

Over the past few decades, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been developed as a powerful platform, which enables in situ characterization of topological structures, local physical properties, and even manipulating samples at nanometer scale. Currently, an imaging mode called PeakForce Tapping (PFT) has attracted more and more attention due to its advantages of nondestructive characterization, high-resolution imaging, and concurrent quantitative property mapping. In this review, the origin, principle, and advantages of PFT on nanoscience are introduced in detail. Three typical applications of this technique, including high-resolution imaging of soft samples in liquid environment, quantitative nanomechanical property mapping, and electrical/electrochemical property measurement will be reviewed comprehensively. The future trends of PFT technique development will be discussed as well.},

Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin semiconductors, such as monolayer h-BN and MoS2 with their atom-level geometry, are currently emerging as new and attractive members of the piezoelectric family. However, their piezoelectric polarization is commonly limited to the in-plane direction of odd-number ultrathin layers, largely restricting their application in integrated nanoelectromechanical systems. Recently, theoretical calculations have predicted the existence of out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectricity in monolayer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3. Here, we experimentally report the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectricity in monolayer to bulk {$\alpha$}-In2Se3, attributed to their noncentrosymmetry originating from the hexagonal stacking. Specifically, the corresponding d33 piezoelectric coefficient of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 increases from 0.34 pm/V (monolayer) to 5.6 pm/V (bulk) without any odd\textendash even effect. In addition, we also demonstrate a type of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3-based flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator as an energy-harvesting cell and electronic skin. The out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectricity in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 flakes offers an opportunity to enable both directional and nondirectional piezoelectric devices to be applicable for self-powered systems and adaptive and strain-tunable electronics/optoelectronics.},

However, due to their poor stability and controllability, most studies focus on eliminating this trap effect, and little consideration was devoted to the applications of their inherent capabilities on electronics. Here, we report the realization of robust trap effect, which can capture carriers and store them steadily, in two-dimensional MoS2xSe2(1-x) via synergistic effect of sulphur vacancies and isoelectronic selenium atoms. As a result, infrared detection with very high photoresponsivity (2.4\,\texttimes\,105\,A\,W-1) and photoswitching ratio (\textasciitilde 108), as well as nonvolatile infrared memory with high program/erase ratio (\textasciitilde 108) and fast switching time, are achieved just based on an individual flake. This demonstration of defect engineering opens up an avenue for achieving high-performance infrared detector and memory.},

The 2D features, sizable bandgaps and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization and device fabrication of the representative MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 TMDs make TMDs very attractive in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Similar to graphite and graphene, the atoms within each layer in 2D TMDs are joined together by covalent bonds, while van der Waals interactions keep the layers together. This makes the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs layer-dependent. In this review, we discuss the basic lattice vibrations of 2D TMDs from monolayer, multilayer to bulk material, including high-frequency optical phonons, interlayer shear and layer breathing phonons, the Raman selection rule, layer-number evolution of phonons, multiple phonon replica and phonons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The extensive capabilities of Raman spectroscopy in investigating the properties of TMDs are discussed, such as interlayer coupling, spin\textendash orbit splitting and external perturbations. The interlayer vibrational modes are used in rapid and substrate-free characterization of the layer number of multilayer TMDs and in probing interface coupling in TMD heterostructures. The success of Raman spectroscopy in investigating TMD nanosheets paves the way for experiments on other 2D crystals and related van der Waals heterostructures.},
