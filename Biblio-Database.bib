	abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of \~{}4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

	abstract = {The pace of two-dimensional materials (2DM) research has been greatly accelerated by the ability to identify exfoliated thicknesses down to a monolayer from their optical contrast. Since this process requires time-consuming and error-prone manual assignment to avoid false-positives from image features with similar contrast, efforts towards fast and reliable automated assignments schemes is essential. We show that by modelling the expected 2DM contrast in digitally captured images, we can automatically identify candidate regions of 2DM. More importantly, we show a computationally-light machine vision strategy for eliminating false-positives from this set of 2DM candidates through the combined use of binary thresholding, opening and closing filters, and shape-analysis from edge detection. Calculation of data pyramids for arbitrarily high-resolution optical coverage maps of two-dimensional materials produced in this way allows the real-time presentation and processing of this image data in a zoomable interface, enabling large datasets to be explored and analysed with ease. The result is that a standard optical microscope with CCD camera can be used as an analysis tool able to accurately determine the coverage, residue/contamination concentration, and layer number for a wide range of presented 2DMs.},

In this work, we present the photolithographic process and the plasma etching of arsenic tri-sulphide (As2S3) film. The films were deposited on thermally oxidized silicon substrates by ultra-fast pulsed laser deposition. To protect As2S3 film from photo-resist developer, thin resist layer \~{}100{\textendash}200nm was remained on the UV exposed area by controlling resist development time. After removing the protective layer in oxygen plasma, As2S3 waveguides were patterned in inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) system using CF4{\textendash}O2 gas mixture. We investigated the etch rate and the etch selectivity to photo-resist of As2S3 as a function of bias power, induction power, operating pressure, and gas flow rate ratio of CF4 and O2. The film is mainly etched by the chemical reaction with fluorine radicals. The content of oxygen in the plasma determines the etched sidewall profiles and nearly vertical profile was obtained at high oxygen content plasma.},

The field dependence of barrier height due to the image force was proposed to be the mechanism for the current through the M-S-M structure when the voltage drop across the reverse-biased barrier is dominating. The proposed model was applied to the I{\textendash}V curves measured at different temperatures on low-resistivity p-type CdTe with Au contacts and the density of the effective acceptors calculated, and the zero-field Schottky barrier height and the Richardson constant were extracted using the activation energy method.

The MSM diode structure is commonly used because an additional MS interface is required for the electrical characterization of MS diodes. A finite charge-injection barrier is generally formed at the additional interface. When a local maximum was detected in the first-order derivative of the measured I-V characteristics for a MSM diode, the parameters for the Schottky contacts, the zero-bias barrier heights of both MS interfaces, the series resistance of the MSM diode, and the effective ideality factor for the MS diode with a higher barrier could be extracted using this method.},

The symmetry breaking is captured by the order parameter known as spontaneous polarization, whose switching under an external electric field results in a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop. In addition, the responses of spontaneous polarization to other external excitations are related to a number of physical effects such as second-harmonic generation, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and dielectric properties.

We find satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the case of bulk benchmark materials, showing that the so-called electron-phonon renormalization, whose contribution has been traditionally viewed as negligible, is important. We predict out-of-plane pyroelectricity in the recently synthesized Janus MoSSe monolayer and in-plane pyroelectricity in the group-IV monochalcogenide GeS monolayer. It is notable that the so-called secondary pyroelectricity is found to be dominant in GeS monolayer.

This transistor-type ferroelectric memory has interesting fundamental device physics and potentially large industrial impact. Among various applications of ferroelectric thin films, the development of nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) has been most actively progressed since the late 1980s and reached modest mass production for specific application since 1995. There are two types of memory cells in ferroelectric nonvolatile memories. One is the capacitor-type FeRAM and the other is the field-effect transistor (FET)-type FeRAM. Although the FET-type FeRAM claims the ultimate scalability and nondestructive readout characteristics, the capacitor-type FeRAMs have been the main interest for the major semiconductor memory companies, because the ferroelectric FET has fatal handicaps of cross-talk for random accessibility and short retention time. This book aims to provide the readers with development history, technical issues, fabrication methodologies, and promising applications of FET-type ferroelectric memory devices, presenting a comprehensive review of past, present, and future technologies. The topics discussed will lead to further advances in large-area electronics implemented on glass, plastic or paper substrates as well as in conventional Si electronics. The book is composed of chapters written by leading researchers in ferroelectric materials and related device technologies, including oxide and organic ferroelectric thin films.},

However, separating ferroelectric effect from many of the factors (such as charge injection/trapping and the presence of mobile ions in the polymer) that confound interpretation is still confusing and controversial. This work presents a methodology to reliably identify the confounding factors which obscure the polarization effect in FeFETs. Careful observation of the Id?Vg curves, as well as monitoring the Id?Vg hysteresis and flat band voltage shift as a function of temperature and sweep frequency, identifies the dominant mechanism. This methodology is demonstrated by using 15 nm thick high glass transition temperature polar polymer-based FeFETs. In these devices, room temperature hysteresis is largely a consequence of charge trapping and mobile ions, while ferroelectric polarization is observed at elevated temperatures. This methodology can be used to unambiguously prove the effect of ferroelectric polarization in FeFETs.},

	abstract = {We present the concept of ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). These junctions consist of two metal electrodes separated by a nanometer-thick ferroelectric barrier. The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed under the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant conduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect inherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The calculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the current-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier thickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge. Remarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to the piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place after the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze the influence of an internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening of polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for asymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable change of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the symmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that characteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from one to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of FTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and depolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar top and bottom electrodes are preferable for the nonvolatile memory applications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.},

Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO3 and both insulating and electron-doped ATiO3 perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO3 (which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO3 and LiOsO3 emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and this mechanism is {\textquoteleft}resistant{\textquoteright} to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising avenues for further research.},

It has been suggested by Anderson and Blount [P. W. Anderson, E. I. Blount, \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} 14, 217-219 (1965)] that a transition from paraelectric phase to FE phase is possible for a metal if, in the paraelectric phase, the electrons at the Fermi level are decoupled from the soft transverse optical phonons, which lead to ferroelectricity. Here, using Raman spectroscopy combined with magnetotransport measurements on a recently discovered FE metal LiOsO$_{\textrm{3}}$, we demonstrate active interplay of itinerant electrons and the FE order: Itinerant electrons cause strong renormalization of the FE order parameter, leading to a more gradual transition in LiOsO$_{\textrm{3}}$ than typical insulating FEs. In return, the FE order enhances the anisotropy of charge transport between parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction. The temperature-dependent evolution of Raman active in-plane $^{\textrm{3}}$E$_{\textrm{g}}$ phonon, which strongly couples to the polar-active out-of-the-plane A$_{\textrm{2u}}$ phonon mode in the high-temperature paraelectric state, exhibits a deviation in Raman shift from the expectation of the pseudospin-phonon model that is widely used to model many insulating FEs. The Curie-Weiss temperature ($\theta$ ? 97 K) obtained from the optical susceptibility is substantially lower than \textit{T}$_{\textrm{s}}$, suggesting a strong suppression of FE fluctuations. Both line width and Fano line shape of $^{\textrm{3}}$E$_{\textrm{g}}$ Raman mode exhibit a strong electron-phonon coupling in the high-temperature paraelectric phase, which disappears in the FE phase, challenging Anderson/Blount{\textquoteright}s proposal for the formation of FE metals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we fabricate a new polar metal film based on the typical ferroelectric material BaTiO3by combining chemical doping and epitaxial strain induced by a substrate. The temperature dependences of the c-axis lattice constant and the second harmonic generation intensity of La-doped BaTiO3films indicate the existence of polar transitions. In addition, through La doping, films become metallic at the polar phase, and metallicity enhancement at the polar state occurs in low-La-doped films. This intriguing behaviour is effectively explained by our first-principles calculations. Our demonstration suggests that the carrier doping to ferroelectric material with epitaxial strain serves as a new way to explore polar metals.},

	abstract = {Ferroelectric tunnel junctions, in which ferroelectric polarization and quantum tunneling are closely coupled to induce the tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect, have attracted considerable interest due to their potential in nonvolatile and low-power consumption memory devices. The ferroelectric size effect, however, has hindered ferroelectric tunnel junctions from exhibiting a robust TER effect. Here, our study proposes doping engineering in a two-dimensional in-plane ferroelectric semiconductor as an effective strategy to design a two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction composed of homostructural p-type semiconductor/ferroelectric/n-type semiconductor. Because the in-plane polarization persists in the monolayer ferroelectric barrier, the vertical thickness of two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction can be as thin as a monolayer. We show that the monolayer In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe junction provides an embodiment of this strategy. Combining density functional theory calculations with nonequilibrium Green{\textquoteright}s function formalism, we investigate the electron transport properties of In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe and reveal a giant TER effect of 1460\%. The dynamical modulation of both barrier width and barrier height during the ferroelectric switching is responsible for this giant TER effect. These findings provide an important insight into the understanding of the quantum behaviors of electrons in materials at the two-dimensional limit and enable new possibilities for next-generation nonvolatile memory devices based on flexible two-dimensional lateral ferroelectric tunnel junctions.},

The films crystallized in the $\gamma$-In2Se3 phase. To confirm and to characterize this phase, the films have been investigated by microprobe analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, Raman diffusion and optical absorption measurements. It is shown that selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of the $\gamma$-In2Se3 phase are obtained and that a very good correlation exists between the planes obtained from X-ray spectra and SAD patterns. Raman diffusion and optical absorption also lead to characteristic data of the $\gamma$-In2Se3 phase, and are compared with the values of the other phases. Moreover it is shown that the occurrence of the $\gamma$-phase is related to the annealing under selenium atmosphere and to the initial Se/In atomic ratio.},

The temperatures of the invariant equilibria: Liq{\textendash}Liq1{\textendash}In4Se3; Liq{\textendash}In4Se3{\textendash}InSe; Liq{\textendash}InSe{\textendash}In6Se7 and Liq{\textendash}In6Se7{\textendash}In2Se3, Liq{\textendash}In2Se3, In2Se3{\textendash}Liq{\textendash}Liq2, and In2Se3{\textendash}Liq{\textendash}Se have been determined to be, respectively: 794 K; 831 K; 891 K; 938 K, 1041 K, and 491.6 K, with congruent melting of In2Se3 1158.4 K. The experimental studies of the enthalpies of fusion for the four compounds give the following values: $\Delta$Hm,In4Se3=7.7 kJmol-1; $\Delta$Hm,InSe=9.6 kJmol-1; $\Delta$Hm,In6Se7=9.14 kJmol-1, $\Delta$Hf,In2Se3=0.103 kJmol-1 (all per mole of atoms). A non-negligible homogeneity region at about 929 K has been revealed for In6Se7. The temperatures and enthalpies of the polymorphic transitions of In2Se3 (according to the nomenclature used until now) were determined: 471 K ($\alpha${\textrightarrow}$\beta$), 913 K ($\beta${\textrightarrow}$\gamma$) and 1021 K ($\gamma${\textrightarrow}$\delta$), respectively, with $\Delta$Htr$\alpha${\textrightarrow}$\beta$=790 Jmol-1; $\Delta$Htr$\beta${\textrightarrow}$\gamma$=650 Jmol-1; and $\Delta$Htr$\gamma${\textrightarrow}$\delta$=190 Jmol-1. New schemes describing the polytypic transitions of the In2Se3 have been proposed. It is shown that a hexagonal modification a=0.717 nm, c=1.941 nm (most known as $\gamma$(H){\textendash}In2Se3) is stable at room temperature while at temperatures higher than ?823 K it transforms to another hexagonal modification a=0.4025 nm, c=1.9235 nm (predominantly known as $\alpha$(H){\textendash}In2Se3). This one can be quenched to room temperature and both of them produce various other metastable modifications on heating or on cooling. The thermodynamic properties of the four line compounds (In4Se3, InSe, In6Se7 and In2Se3) were revised using literature sources and our experimental data. It is possible that the InSe (and not In2Se3) is the most stable compound in the system indium{\textendash}selenium.},

The photoconductive response of $\alpha$-In2Se3 nanosheets extends into ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral regions. The high photocurrent response is attributed to the direct band gap (EG = 1.3 eV) of In2Se3 combined with a large surface-area-to-volume ratio and a self-terminated/native-oxide-free surface, which help to reduce carrier recombination while keeping fast response, allowing for real-time detection under very low-light conditions.},

Particularly, using electron microscopy and correlative in situ micro-Raman and electrical measurements, we show that, in contrast to bulk single crystals, the $\beta$ phase can persist in single-crystal thin layers at room temperature (RT). The single-crystal nature of the layers before and after the phase transition allows for unambiguous determination of changes in the electrical resistivity. Specifically, the $\beta$ phase has an electrical resistivity about 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude lower than the $\alpha$ phase. Furthermore, we find that the temperature of the $\alpha$ {\textrightarrow} $\beta$ phase transformation increases by as much as 130 K with the layer thickness decreasing from \~{}87 nm to \~{}4 nm. These single-crystal thin layers are ideal for studying the scaling behavior of the phase transformations and associated changes of the electrical properties. For these In2Se3 thin layers, the accessibility of the $\beta$ phase at RT, with distinct electrical properties than the $\alpha$ phase, provides the basis for multilevel phase-change memories in a single material system.},

Die Phasenverh{\"a}ltnisse des polymorphen In2Se3 wurden mit Hilfe von R{\"o}ntgenheizaufnahmen untersucht. Die bei Raumtemperatur stabile Modifikation $\gamma$-In2Se3 (hP30) mit vier-und f{\"u}nffacher Koordination des Indiums zeigt bei 960 K eine Phasenumwandlung in das dichter gepackte $\beta$-In2Se3(H) (hP10) (KZ = 6?), welches bei 1080 K in das stark fehlgeordnete $\delta$-In2Se3 (hP5) {\"u}bergeht. Beim Abk{\"u}hlen der Hochtemperaturformen erh{\"a}lt man gew{\"o}hnlich nicht $\gamma$-In2Se3, sondern Varianten des $\beta$-In2Se3, n{\"a}mlich $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) ($\alpha$(2)-In2Se3) (hP10) und $\alpha$-In2Se3(R) ($\alpha$(3)-In2Se3) (hR5), die beim Aufheizen {\"u}ber die ebenfalls metastabilen Formen $\beta$'-In2Se3 (hP15) und $\beta$-In2Se3(R) (hR5) in das stabile $\gamma$-In2Se3 {\"u}bergehen. Bei Raumtemperatur stabil bzw. metastabil sind nur $\gamma$-In2Se3, $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) und $\alpha$-In2Se3(R). Die Infrarotspektren und r{\"o}ntgenographischen Dichten der verschiedenen polymorphen Formen des In2Se3 sowie die Art der Phasenumwandlungen werden diskutiert.
The phase relationships of polymorphic In2Se3 were reinvestigated by high-temperature X-ray powder studies. The modification, which is (contrary to most references) stable at room temperature, is $\gamma$-In2Se3 (hP30) with four-fold and fivefold coordinated indium ions. Above 960 K $\gamma$-In2Se3 undergoes a phase transition to the more dense (CN = 6?) $\beta$-In2Se3(H) (hP10), which changes to $\delta$-In2Se3 (hP5) above 1080 K. On cooling the high-temperature polymorphs to ambient temperature the stable $\gamma$-In2Se3 is not normally obtained, but metastable variants of $\beta$-In2Se3, viz. $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) ($\alpha$(2)-In2Se3) (hP10) or $\alpha$-In2Se3(R) ($\alpha$(3)-In2Se3) (hR5), which transform on heating via the similarly metastable $\beta$'-In2Se3 (hP15) and $\beta$-In2Se3(R) (hR5), respectively, into $\gamma$-In2Se3. The only stable or metastable polymorphs which exist at ambient temperature are $\gamma$-In2Se3, $\alpha$-In2Se3(H) and $\alpha$-In2Se3(R). The IR spectra and X-ray densities of the various polymorphs of In2Se3 as well as the phase transitions are discussed in terms of the possible structures.},

	abstract = {Crystals grown in the direction of high-energy facets have reduced surface energy, a small portion of high-energy crystal facets, and high photocatalytic activity. In this work, $\gamma$-In2Se3 nanoparticles with predominantly exposed \{110\} facets are synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). EDTA plays a key role in regulating the exposed \{110\} facets and by adding 0.04 M of EDTA, tetragonal prismatic $\gamma$-In2Se3 nanoparticles with the \{110\} facets are produced. Studies of the photocatalytic activity of tetracycline (TC) reveal that the tetragonal prismatic $\gamma$-In2Se3 prepared with 0.04 M EDTA has the optimal activity that is about 1.9 times higher than that of conical $\gamma$-In2Se3 prepared without EDTA. The capture experiments show that h+ and O2- affect degradation of TC and our results reveal a novel strategy to synthesize $\gamma$-In2Se3 with the optimal morphology and photocatalytic activity.},

This feature has plagued its characterization over the years, with reported band gaps varying in an unacceptable range of 1 eV. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and the HSE06 hybrid functional, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of four layered phases of In2Se3, addressing their relative stability and the nature of their fundamental band gaps, i.e., direct versus indirect. Our results show large disparities between fundamental and optical gaps. The absorption coefficients are found to be as high as those in direct-gap III-V semiconductors. The band alignment with respect to conventional semiconductors indicate a tendency to n-type conductivity, explaining recent experimental observations.},

In this work, we investigate 2D In2Se3 synthesized via chemical vapor deposition, a recently discovered 2D ferroelectric material. We observed that In2Se3 layers with thickness ranging from a single layer to \~{}20 layers stabilized at the $\beta$ phase with a superstructure at room temperature. At around 180 K, the $\beta$ phase converted to a more stable $\beta$' phase that was distinct from previously reported phases in 2D In2Se3. The kinetics of the reversible thermally driven $\beta$-to-$\beta$' phase transformation was investigated by temperature-dependent transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, corroborated with the expected minimum-energy pathways obtained from our first-principles calculations. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal in-plane ferroelectricity in the $\beta$' phase. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show that the indirect bandgap of monolayer $\beta$' In2Se3 is 2.50 eV, which is larger than that of the multilayer form with a measured value of 2.05 eV. Our results on the reversible thermally driven phase transformation in 2D In2Se3 with thickness down to the monolayer limit and the associated electronic properties will provide insights to tune the functionalities of 2D In2Se3 and other emerging 2D ferroelectric materials and shed light on their numerous potential applications (e.g., nonvolatile memory devices).},

In this work, we utilize angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to directly measure the electronic band structure of $\beta$'-In2Se3 and compare to hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In agreement with DFT, we find the band structure is highly two-dimensional, with negligible dispersion along the c-axis. Because of n-type doping we can observe the conduction band minima and directly measure the minimum indirect (0.97 eV) and direct (1.46 eV) bandgaps. We find the Fermi surface in the conduction band is characterized by anisotropic electron pockets with sharp in-plane dispersion about the M? points, yielding effective masses of 0.21m0 along KM and 0.33m0 along $\Gamma$M. The measured band structure is well supported by hybrid density functional theory calculations. The highly two-dimensional (2D) band structure with moderate bandgap and small effective mass suggests that $\beta$'-In2Se3 is a potentially useful van der Waals semiconductor. This, together with its ferroelectricity makes it a viable material for high-mobility ferroelectric{\textendash}photovoltaic devices, with applications in nonvolatile memory switching and renewable energy technologies.},

	abstract = {Abstract Indium selenide undergoes several reversible inter- and intrapolytypic phase transitions, above and below room temperature. A number of superstructures of the hexagonal (or rhombohedral) room temperature phase have been discovered by means of electron diffraction. The transition at 200 {\textdegree}C which corresponds to the $\alpha$ ? ? transformation is accompanied by intense non-radial diffuse scattering, which is attributed to anisotropic transverse acoustic phonons. On cooling, a one-dimensional deformation modulated structure is formed, which is interpreted as the frozen-in configuration of the predominant vibration mode, which becomes soft below the transition temperature in the range 60 to 200 {\textdegree}C. This transition shows a large hysteresis, which is also found in thermal expansion. A new low temperature phase, which is presumably orthorhombic, is discovered on cooling below ?125 {\textdegree}C. The structure of this phase can alternatively be described as being the result of pairing of indium ions or as the frozen-in configuration of a longitudinal mode. Both phases exhibit a domain structure, which in the case of the $\alpha$-phase can be revealed by lattice resolution. Several high temperature superstructures are observed by means of electron diffraction. A direct relationship with the ?-phase is established and in a number of cases the superperiods are directly imaged.},

Recently emerged ferroelectric two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdWs) layered materials bring an additional opportunity to further increase the density of FeRAMs. A lateral, switchable rectifier is designed and fabricated based on atomically thin 2D $\alpha$-In2Se3 ferroelectric diodes, thus breaking the thickness limitation of conventional ferroelectric films and achieving an unprecedented level of miniaturization. This is realized through the interrelated coupling between out-of-plane and in-plane dipoles at room temperature; that is, horizontal polarization reversal can be effectively controlled through a vertical electric field. Being further explored as a switchable rectifier, the obtained maximum value of rectification ratio for the $\alpha$-In2Se3 based ferroelectric diode can reach up to 2.5 ? 103. These results indicate that 2D ferroelectric semiconductors can offer a pathway to develop next-generation multifunctional electronics.},

Here we report the experimental discovery of the locking between out-of-plane dipoles and in-plane lattice asymmetry in atomically thin In2Se3 crystals, a new stabilization mechanism leading to our observation of intrinsic 2D out-of-plane ferroelectricity. Through second harmonic generation spectroscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy, we found switching of out-of-plane electric polarization requires a flip of nonlinear optical polarization that corresponds to the inversion of in-plane lattice orientation. The polar order shows a very high transition temperature (\~{}700 K) without the assistance of extrinsic screening.

Here we report on photodetectors incorporating the layered material In2Se3, which allow complete modulation of a high gain, photogating mechanism in the ON state in favor of fast photoconduction in the OFF state. While photoconduction is largely gate independent, photocurrent from the photogating effect is strongly modulated through application of a back gate voltage. By varying the back gate, we demonstrate control over the dominant mechanism responsible for photocurrent generation. Furthermore, because of the strong photogating effect, these direct-band gap, multilayer phototransistors produce ultrahigh gains of (9.8 {\textpm} 2.5) {\texttimes} 104 A/W and inferred detectivities of (3.3 {\textpm} 0.8) {\texttimes} 1013 Jones, putting In2Se3 among the most sensitive 2D materials for photodetection studied to date.},

	abstract = {Amorphous chalcogenide thin films, especially arsenic tri-sulphide (As2S3) are emerging as an excellent platform for integrated non-linear optic devices due to their high non-linearity as well as low linear and nonlinear optical loss. Fabricating planar As2S3 waveguides, however, is not straightforward because As2S3 is dissolved in alkalis such as photo-resist developer. In this study we present the application of thin SU-8 film as a protective layer to prevent the attack of the developer on the As2S3 during photolithographic process. Despite excellent coating feature and simple process of SU-8 as a protective layer, the delamination between SU-8 and polymer cladding during chip cleaving hindered its application. We deposited thin Al2O3 on SU-8 by atomic layer deposition and this intermediate layer could solve the problem. We measured the insertion losses of fabricated waveguides as a function of device lengths and widths. The propagation loss becomes significant in a narrow guide due to the enhanced surface scattering. It was clear that extra losses were engaged in long guides containing bending structures. SU-8 layer and thin Al2O3 combination allowed reliable and repeatable fabrication process in that it did not induce any extra light scattering or absorption and prevented attack of the As2S3 film by the alkaline developer. Moreover, the device characterisation revealed that SU-8 layer is superior to PMMA/BARC in terms of propagation loss of waveguide ({\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

	abstract = {Equilibrium crystal structures, electron band dispersions, and bandgap values of layered GaSe and InSe semiconductors, each being represented by four polytypes, are studied via first-principles calculations within the density functional theory. A number of practical algorithms to take into account dispersion interactions are tested, from empirical Grimme corrections to many-body dispersion schemes. Due to the utmost technical accuracy achieved in the calculations, nearly degenerate energy-volume curves of different polytypes are resolved, and the conclusions concerning the relative stability of competing polytypes drawn. The predictions are done as for how the equilibrium between different polytypes will be shifted under the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The band structures are inspected under the angle of identifying features specific for different polytypes and with respect to modifications of the band dispersions brought about by the use of modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) scheme for the exchange-correlation potential. As another way to improve the predictions of bandgaps values, hybrid functional calculations according to the HSE06 scheme are performed for the band structures, and the relation with the mBJ results are discussed. Both methods nicely agree with the experimental results and with state-of-the-art GW calculations. Some discrepancies are identified in cases of close competition between the direct and indirect gap (e.g., in GaSe); moreover, the accurate placement of bands revealing relatively localized states is slightly different according to mBJ and HSE06 schemes.},

The MoS2- and CuInP2S6-based 2D van der Waals heterostructure Fe-FETs exhibit a clear counterclockwise hysteresis loop in transfer characteristics, demonstrating their ferroelectric properties. This stable nonvolatile memory property can also be modulated by the back-gate bias of the MoS2 transistors because of the tuning of capacitance matching between the MoS2 channel and the ferroelectric CuInP2S6, leading to the enhancement of the on/off current ratio. Meanwhile, the CuInP2S6 thin film also shows resistive switching characteristics with more than four orders of on/off ratio between low- and high-resistance states, which is also promising for resistive random-access memory applications.},

A ferroelectric field-effect transistor combines a ferroelectric material with a semiconductor in a transistor structure. In doing so, it merges logic and memory functionalities at the single-device level, delivering some of the most pressing hardware-level demands for emerging computing paradigms. Here, we examine the potential of the ferroelectric field-effect transistor technologies in current embedded non-volatile memory applications and future in-memory, biomimetic and alternative computing models. We highlight the material- and device-level challenges involved in high-volume manufacturing in advanced technology nodes (<=10 nm), which are reminiscent of those encountered in the early days of high-K-metal-gate transistor development. We argue that the ferroelectric field-effect transistors can be a key hardware component in the future of computing, providing a new approach to electronics that we term ferroelectronics.},

This work will examine two major causes of the short retention (assuming no significant mobile ionic charge motion in the ferroelectric film): 1) depolarization field and 2) finite gate leakage current. A possible solution to the memory retention problem will be suggested, which involves the growth of single-crystal, single domain ferroelectric on Si.

Here, we demonstrate a switchable room-temperature ferroelectric diode built upon a 2D ferroelectric $\alpha$-In2Se3 layer as thin as 5 nm in the form of a graphene/$\alpha$-In2Se3 heterojunction.

Owing to the out-of-plane ferroelectricity of the $\alpha$-In2Se3 layer, the Schottky barrier at the graphene/$\alpha$-In2Se3 interface can be effectively tuned by switching the electric polarization with an applied voltage, leading to a pronounced switchable double diode effect with an on/off ratio of \~{}105.

The electronic logic bit can be represented and stored with different orientations of electric dipoles in the top-gate ferroelectric. The 2D FeFET can be randomly rewritten over more than 105 cycles without losing the nonvolatility. The approach demonstrates a prototype of rewritable nonvolatile memory with ferroelectricity in van der Waals 2D materials.},

However, the controversy on the structures of In2Se3 strongly hinders the exploitation of its properties and potentially gives rise to misdirection of its applications. Here, taking advantage of state-of-the-art aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate the atomic-scale structures of lab-created and purchased In2Se3 compounds. Six phases in three polymorphs at room temperature have been observed among all the samples, which include 2H and 3R $\alpha$-In2Se3, 1T, 2H, and 3R $\beta$-In2Se3, and none-layered $\gamma$-In2Se3. Raman spectra are directly correlated to individual In2Se3 phases, providing fingerprints for identifying various phases of In2Se3. In addition, obvious out-of-plane ferroelectricity of 2H $\alpha$-In2Se3 was also observed by piezoresponse force microscopy, enabling its potential application in ferroelectric devices.},

Recently, van der Waals ferroelectric In2Se3 with unique interlinked out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations has enabled multidirectional resistance switching, providing unprecedented flexibility in planar and vertical device integrations. However, the operating mechanisms of these devices have remained unclear. Here, through the demonstration of van der Waals In2Se3-based planar ferroelectric memristors with the device resistance continuously tunable over three orders of magnitude, and by correlating device resistance states, ferroelectric domain configurations, and surface electric potential, the studies reveal that the resistive switching is controlled by the multidomain formations and the associated energy barriers between domains, as opposed to the commonly assumed Schottky barrier modulations at the metal-ferroelectric interface. The findings reveal new device physics through elucidating the microscopic operating mechanisms of this new generation of devices, and provide a critical guide for future device development and integration efforts.},

In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time- and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a single-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize [{\textquotedblleft}The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016,{\textquotedblright} http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel\_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ (Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also resulted in a growing number of reports on the nearly ubiquitous presence of ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in the bulk or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric-like responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible mechanisms behind observed behaviors and possible experimental strategies for their identification.},

	abstract = {Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a powerful characterization technique to readily image and manipulate the ferroelectric domains. PFM gives an insight into the strength of local piezoelectric coupling and polarization direction through PFM amplitude and phase, respectively. Converting measured arbitrary units into units of effective piezoelectric constant remains a challenge, and insufficient methods are often used. While most quantification efforts have been spent on quantifying the PFM amplitude signal, little attention has been given to the PFM phase, which is often arbitrarily adjusted to fit expectations. This is problematic when investigating materials with unknown or negative sign of the probed effective electrostrictive coefficient or strong frequency dispersion of electromechanical responses, because assumptions about the PFM phase cannot be reliably made. The PFM phase can, however, provide important information on the polarization orientation and the sign of the effective electrostrictive coefficient probed by PFM. Most notably, the orientation of the PFM hysteresis loop is determined by the PFM phase. Moreover, when presenting PFM data as a combined signal, the resulting response can be artificially lowered or asymmetric if the phase data have not been correctly processed. Here, we explain the PFM amplitude quantification process and demonstrate a path to identify the phase offset required to extract correct meaning from the PFM phase data. We explore different sources of phase offsets including the experimental setup, instrumental contributions, and data analysis. We discuss the physical working principles of PFM and develop a strategy to extract physical meaning from the PFM amplitude and phase.},

In the last several years, the rapid development of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy revealed the presence of electromechanical hysteresis loops and bias-induced remnant polar states in a broad variety of materials including many inorganic oxides, polymers, and biosystems. In many cases, this behavior was interpreted as the ample evidence for ferroelectric nature of the system. Here, we systematically analyze PFM responses on ferroelectric and nonferroelectric materials and demonstrate that mechanisms unrelated to ferroelectricity can induce ferroelectric-like characteristics through charge injection and electrostatic forces on the tip. We will focus on similarities and differences in various PFM measurement characteristics to provide an experimental guideline to differentiate between ferroelectric material properties and charge injection. In the end, we apply the developed measurement protocols to an unknown ferroelectric material.},

Two-dimensional atomic crystals are a versatile playground to study the influence of strain, as they can sustain very large deformations without breaking. Various optical techniques have been employed to probe strain in two-dimensional materials, including micro-Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Here we demonstrate that optical second harmonic generation constitutes an even more powerful technique, as it allows extraction of the full strain tensor with a spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. Our method is based on the strain-induced modification of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor due to a photoelastic effect. Using a two-point bending technique, we determine the photoelastic tensor elements of molybdenum disulfide. Once identified, these parameters allow us to spatially image the two-dimensional strain field in an inhomogeneously strained sample.},

SHG for materials with odd layer thickness was measured as a function of crystal orientation. This dependence reveals the rotational symmetry of the lattice and is shown to provide a purely optical method of determining the orientation of crystallographic axes.

	abstract = {Nonlinear optics is an essential component of modern laser systems and optoelectronic devices. It has also emerged as an important tool in probing the electronic, vibrational, magnetic, and crystallographic structure of materials ranging from oxides and metals, to polymers and biological samples. This review focuses on the specific technique of optical second harmonic generation (SHG), and its application in probing ferroelectric complex oxide crystals and thin films. As the dominant SHG interaction mechanism exists only in materials that lack inversion symmetry, SHG is a sensitive probe of broken inversion symmetry, and thus also of bulk polar phenomena in materials. By performing in-situ SHG polarimetry experiments in different experimental conditions such as sample orientation, applied electric field, and temperature, one can probe ferroelectric hysteresis loops and phase transitions. Careful modeling of the polarimetry data allows for the determination of the point group symmetry of the crystal. In epitaxial thin films with a two-dimensional arrangement of well-defined domain orientations, one can extract information about intrinsic material properties such as nonlinear coefficients, as well as microstructural information such as the local statistics of the different domain variants being probed. This review presents several detailed examples of ferroelectric systems where such measurements and modeling are performed. The use of SHG microscopic imaging is discussed, and its ability to reveal domain structures and phases not normally visible with linear optics is illustrated.},

To fully explore their exotic physical properties and facilitate potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics, an effective and versatile characterization method is highly demanded. Among the many methods of characterization, optical second harmonic generation (SHG) has attracted broad attention because of its sensitivity, versatility and simplicity. The SHG technique is sufficiently sensitive at the atomic scale and therefore suitable for studies on 2D materials. More importantly, it has the capacity to acquire abundant information ranging from crystallographic, and electronic, to magnetic properties in various 2D materials due to its sensitivity to both spatial-inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. These advantages accompanied by its characteristics of non-invasion and high throughput make SHG a powerful tool for 2D materials. This review summarizes recent experimental developments of SHG applications in 2D materials and also provides an outlook of potential prospects based on SHG.},

	abstract = {Abstract The investigation of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics has attracted significant interest in recent years for applications in functional electronics. Without the limitation of a finite size effect, 2D materials with stable layered structures and reduced surface energy may go beyond the presence of an enhanced depolarization field in ultrathin ferroelectrics, thereby opening a pathway to explore low-dimensional ferroelectricity, making ultra-high-density devices possible and maintaining Moore's Law. Although many theoretical works on potential 2D ferroelectric materials have been conducted, much still needs to be accomplished experimentally, as it is rare for 2D ferroelectric materials to be proven and plenty of 2D ferroelectrics are waiting to be discovered. First, experimental and theoretical progress on 2D ferroelectric materials, including in-plane and out-of-plane, is reviewed, followed by a general introduction to various characterization methods. Intrinsic mechanisms associated with promising 2D ferroelectric materials, together with related applications, are also discussed. Finally, an outlook for future trends and development in 2D ferroelectricity are explored. Researchers can use this to obtain a basic understanding of 2D ferroelectric materials and to build a database of progress of 2D ferroelectrics.},

Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the boron atoms were spaced 4.76 nm apart in single-layer graphene. The 7-fold higher intensity of the D-band when compared to the G-band was explained by the elastically scattered photoexcited electrons by boron atoms before emitting a phonon. The frequency of the G-band in single-layer substitutionally boron-doped graphene was unchanged, which could be explained by the p-type boron doping (stiffening) counteracting the tensile strain effect of the larger carbon{\textendash}boron bond length (softening).

The 2D features, sizable bandgaps and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization and device fabrication of the representative MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 TMDs make TMDs very attractive in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Similar to graphite and graphene, the atoms within each layer in 2D TMDs are joined together by covalent bonds, while van der Waals interactions keep the layers together. This makes the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs layer-dependent. In this review, we discuss the basic lattice vibrations of 2D TMDs from monolayer, multilayer to bulk material, including high-frequency optical phonons, interlayer shear and layer breathing phonons, the Raman selection rule, layer-number evolution of phonons, multiple phonon replica and phonons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The extensive capabilities of Raman spectroscopy in investigating the properties of TMDs are discussed, such as interlayer coupling, spin{\textendash}orbit splitting and external perturbations. The interlayer vibrational modes are used in rapid and substrate-free characterization of the layer number of multilayer TMDs and in probing interface coupling in TMD heterostructures. The success of Raman spectroscopy in investigating TMD nanosheets paves the way for experiments on other 2D crystals and related van der Waals heterostructures.},

The unique band structures of strong in-plane chemical bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions make 2D materials promising for nanodevices and various other applications. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and non-destructive characterization tool to study the properties of 2D materials. In this work, we review the research on the characterization of 2D materials with Raman spectroscopy. In addition, we discuss the application of the Raman spectroscopy technique to semiconductors, superconductivity, photoelectricity, and thermoelectricity.},

	abstract = {Ferroelectric (FE) distortions in a metallic material were believed to be experimentally inaccessible because itinerant electrons would screen the long-range Coulomb interactions that favor a polar structure. It has been suggested by Anderson and Blount [P. W. Anderson, E. I. Blount, Phys. Rev. Lett. 14, 217-219 (1965)] that a transition from paraelectric phase to FE phase is possible for a metal if, in the paraelectric phase, the electrons at the Fermi level are decoupled from the soft transverse optical phonons, which lead to ferroelectricity. Here, using Raman spectroscopy combined with magnetotransport measurements on a recently discovered FE metal LiOsO3, we demonstrate active interplay of itinerant electrons and the FE order: Itinerant electrons cause strong renormalization of the FE order parameter, leading to a more gradual transition in LiOsO3 than typical insulating FEs. In return, the FE order enhances the anisotropy of charge transport between parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction. The temperature-dependent evolution of Raman active in-plane 3Eg phonon, which strongly couples to the polar-active out-of-the-plane A2u phonon mode in the high-temperature paraelectric state, exhibits a deviation in Raman shift from the expectation of the pseudospin-phonon model that is widely used to model many insulating FEs. The Curie-Weiss temperature ($\theta$ ? 97 K) obtained from the optical susceptibility is substantially lower than Ts, suggesting a strong suppression of FE fluctuations. Both line width and Fano line shape of 3Eg Raman mode exhibit a strong electron-phonon coupling in the high-temperature paraelectric phase, which disappears in the FE phase, challenging Anderson/Blount{\textquoteright}s proposal for the formation of FE metals.},

	abstract = {Previous high-pressure dielectric and diffraction studies on rubidium hydrogen sulfate (RbHSO4) observed ferroelectric phase transition below 1 GPa pressure. We have performed high-pressure Raman spectroscopy studies on RbHSO4 up to a maximum pressure of 5.15 GPa and at ambient temperature to understand the microscopic origin and mechanism of ferroelectric transition. On the basis of the pressure dependence of Raman mode frequencies and their full-width at half-maxima, we observed a transition around a pressure of 0.3 GPa, similar to the ferroelectric transition discovered in dielectric measurements, followed by another transition around 2.4 GPa. These phase transitions are evident from the appearance/disappearance of Raman-active modes and the change in the slope of frequencies with pressures. From the pressure dependence of the S{\textendash}O and S{\textendash}OH frequencies, we deduce that HSO4{\textendash} ion ordering results in ferroelectric phase transition around 0.3 GPa. Further, the transition around 2.4 GPa pressure is associated with significant changes in the stretching and bending vibrational frequencies and indicates a structural phase transition with possible lowering of the crystal symmetry. Interestingly, no significant changes are observed in the Raman spectrum around 1 GPa, at which a phase transition was noticed in earlier X-ray and dielectric studies.},

If the polarization of the incident photons and the scattered photons are carefully controlled, the selection rules for the Raman scattering from phonon modes allow accurate mode assignments, which is not always possible in Raman scattering measurements using unpolarized light. Furthermore, polarized Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the crystallographic orientation of isotropic 2DMs with in-plane strain or anisotropic 2DMs. This review explains the basics of polarized Raman spectroscopy, especially in the context of 2DMs research, and survey some of the most important applications of polarized Raman spectroscopy in isotropic and anisotropic 2DMs studies.},

	abstract = {Uniaxial ferroelectric BaTi2O5 with a Curie temperature TC of 743 K was investigated to clarify its paraelectric-ferroelectric phase-transition behavior. The mechanism is discussed on the basis of the structure from short to long ranges determined by synchrotron x-ray diffraction and the lattice dynamics probed by Raman spectroscopy. BaTi2O5 is regarded as a homogeneous system, and the lattice dynamics can be interpreted by the selection rules and tensor properties of the homogeneous structure. Angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy clearly shows that an A-mode-type overdamped phonon plays the key role in the phase transition. Using a combination of experimental results and first-principles calculations, we explain the phase transition as follows: In one of three TiO6 octahedral units, Ti vibrates along the b axis opposite an oxygen octahedral unit with large damping in the paraelectric phase, whereas this vibration is frozen in the ferroelectric phase, leading to a change in the space group from nonpolar C2/m to polar C2.},

Experimentally detecting displacements of such a small amplitude in a particular direction is extremely challenging. Through our detailed angle resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy study on single crystal of CuO, we have validated the theoretical study and provided direct evidence of displacement along the b axis.

Recently, van der Waals ferroelectric In2Se3 with unique interlinked out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations has enabled multidirectional resistance switching, providing unprecedented flexibility in planar and vertical device integrations. However, the operating mechanisms of these devices have remained unclear. Here, through the demonstration of van der Waals In2Se3-based planar ferroelectric memristors with the device resistance continuously tunable over three orders of magnitude, and by correlating device resistance states, ferroelectric domain configurations, and surface electric potential, the studies reveal that the resistive switching is controlled by the multidomain formations and the associated energy barriers between domains, as opposed to the commonly assumed Schottky barrier modulations at the metal-ferroelectric interface. The findings reveal new device physics through elucidating the microscopic operating mechanisms of this new generation of devices, and provide a critical guide for future device development and integration efforts.},

In this work, we synthesize monolayer WS2 under various controlled conditions and characterize the films using photoluminescence, Raman and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. We demonstrate that the introduction of hydrogen to the argon carrier gas dramatically improves the optical quality and increases the growth area of WS2, resulting in films exhibiting mm2 coverage. The addition of hydrogen more effectively reduces the WO3 precursor and protects against oxidative etching of the synthesized monolayers. The stoichiometric WS2 monolayers synthesized using Ar + H2 carrier gas exhibit superior optical characteristics, with photoluminescence emission full width half maximum (FWHM) values below 40 meV and emission intensities nearly an order of magnitude higher than films synthesized in a pure Ar environment.},

This possibility constitutes the birth of a very active research field on the so-called van der Waals heterostructures. Moreover, these deterministic placement methods also open the door to fabricate complex devices, which would be otherwise very difficult to achieve by conventional bottom-up nanofabrication approaches, and to fabricate fully-encapsulated devices with exquisite electronic properties. The integration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and superconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of the deterministic placement methods, describing and comparing the different alternative methods available in the literature, and we illustrate their potential to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures, to integrate 2D materials into complex devices and to fabricate artificial bilayer structures where the layers present a user-defined rotational twisting angle.},
