They are characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy techniques. While the InSe films are found to be amorphous, the ZnSe and InSe/ZnSe films exhibited polycrystalline nature of crystallization. The optical analysis has shown that these devices exhibit a conduction band offsets of 0.47 and valence band offsets of 0.67 and 0.74 eV, respectively. In addition, while the dielectric spectra of the InSe and ZnSe displayed resonance peaks at 416 and 528 THz, the dielectric spectra of InSe/ZnSe and InSe/ZnSe/InSe layers indicated two additional peaks at 305 and 350 THz, respectively. On the other hand, the optical conductivity analysis and modeling in the light of free carrier absorption theory reflected low values of drift mobilities associated with incident alternating electric fields at terahertz frequencies. The drift mobility of the charge carrier particles at femtoseconds scattering times increased as a result of the ZnSe sandwiching between two InSe layers. The valence band offsets, the dielectric resonance at 305 and 350 THz and the optical conductivity values nominate TFT devices for use in optoelectronics.},

  abstract = {We report on the high-temperature operation and reliability of the Si-doped hafnium oxide (HSO) ferroelectric FET (FeFET) emerging memory. In this study, we explore the role of high-temperature operation of the ferroelectric (FE) material on the FeFET in the temperature range of 40-120 \textdegree C. The inverse memory window (MW) dependence on temperature leads to a very small MW size ( 300 mV) at 120 \textdegree C. The recovery of MW size at room temperature (RT) indicates a potential pyroelectric effect as a cause for MW closure upon high-temperature operation. The FeFET state readout shows pronounced effects to erase (ER) threshold voltage (Vth) shift, due to the decrease in remnant polarization and improved substrate Vth shift as the temperature increases. The endurance reliability measured for temperature range (-40 \textdegree C to 40 \textdegree C) with 105 cycles shows a maximized initial MW at low temperatures, whereas higher postcycling interface trap generation occurs as the temperature increases. The FeFET 10 h retention tests at 0 \textdegree C and 40 \textdegree C were extrapolated to ten years and indicated stable properties independent of temperature. The depolarization field (Ed) dependence on the FeFET stack parameters is studied based on an analytical formula. The Ed decreases with increased permittivity of the FE, interface layer (IL), and increased FE film thickness. Substrate doping and temperature seem to have a small impact on Ed, whereas the FE-IL area ratio tuning below unity lowers the Ed. The role of pyroelectric effect on the FeFET memory and operating temperature-induced endurance and retention reliability concerns are discussed.},

The gate voltage changes the number of charged traps which results in a sharp change in the resistivity. The observed exponential temperature dependence of the resistivity in the metallic phase of the transition follows from the temperature dependence of the trap occupation number. The model naturally describes the experimentally observed scaling properties of the transition and the effects of magnetic and electric fields.}

This typically happens whenever the intersite Coulomb repulsion induces a tendency toward charge ordering, an effect that confines the electrons, and in turn favors local moment formation, i.e., Mott localization. A distinct intermediate regime then emerges as a precursor of such a Wigner-Mott transition, which is characterized by both charge and spin correlations, displaying large mass enhancements and strong renormalizations of other Fermi-liquid parameters. Here we present a careful study of a quarter-filled extended Hubbard model\textemdash a simple example where such physics can be studied in detail, and discuss its relevance for the understanding of the phenomenology of low-density two-dimensional electron gases.}

It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.}

  abstract = {The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has stimulated considerable interest in the scientific community. Owing to quantum confinement in one direction, intriguing properties have been reported in 2D materials that cannot be observed in their bulk form. The advent of semiconducting 2D materials with a broad range of electronic properties has provided fascinating opportunities to design and configure next-generation electronics. One such emerging class is the family of III-VI monochalcogenides, the two prominent members of which are indium selenide (InSe) and gallium selenide (GaSe). In contrast to transition metal dichalcogenides, their high intrinsic mobility and the availability of a direct bandgap at small thicknesses have attracted researchers to investigate the underlying physical phenomena as well as their technological applications. However, the sensitivity of InSe and GaSe to environmental influences has limited their exploitation in functional devices. The lack of methods for their scalable synthesis further hinders the realization of their devices. This review article outlines recent advancements in the synthesis and understanding of the charge transport properties of InSe and GaSe for their integration into technological applications. A detailed summary of the improvements in the device structure by optimizing extrinsic factors such as bottom substrates, metal contacts, and device fabrication schemes is provided. Furthermore, various encapsulation techniques that have been proven effective in preventing the degradation of InSe and GaSe layers under ambient conditions are thoroughly discussed. Finally, this article presents an outlook on future research ventures with respect to ongoing developments and practical viability of these materials.},

These unusual properties are due to alteration of the Fermi energy position, density of states, and work function of those heterostructures rather than their chemical components. The physical and quantum properties, the interfacial layer and the synergistic effect of each component in 2D heterostructures lead to the generation of new behavior and properties. In this review article, we are focusing on the recent progress in studying the characteristics and properties of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures, and their significant applications in advanced energy storage and conversion devices. In this context, we firstly introduce bottom-up wet chemical approaches for the synthesis of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures. The electron transfer, bonding chemistry and defects at the interface of these heterostructures are then discussed. Thirdly, the tunable properties of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures and their applications in advanced energy storage and conversion devices are presented. The final section discusses the challenges and future prospects of 2D graphene/TMO heterostructures.},

In many cases, this behavior was interpreted as the ample evidence for ferroelectric nature of the system. Here, we systematically analyze PFM responses on ferroelectric and nonferroelectric materials and demonstrate that mechanisms unrelated to ferroelectricity can induce ferroelectric-like characteristics through charge injection and electrostatic forces on the tip. We will focus on similarities and differences in various PFM measurement characteristics to provide an experimental guideline to differentiate between ferroelectric material properties and charge injection. In the end, we apply the developed measurement protocols to an unknown ferroelectric material.},

The aim of the current review is to present these new theoretical methods and to highlight the most essential results obtained in their framework. While theoretical consideration in the article by B\"assler was based on computer simulations, particular attention in the current review is given to the development of analytical theories. Dependences of charge carrier mobility and diffusivity on temperature, electric field, carrier concentration and on material and sample parameters are discussed in detail.

A thermally activated process was observed for the electronic recombination at high temperatures with activation energies of 15(2) meV and 12(1) meV for the Si- and Zn-doped samples, respectively, and attributed to Si shallow donors present in both samples. A reduced number of available electrons was observed in the Zn-doped sample due to donor compensation by the Zn acceptors. At low temperatures, it is suggested that the recombination process occurs via Variable Range Hopping. The doping characteristics of both samples were successfully distinguished.},

  abstract = {A versatile electrochemical system for the non-aqueous electrodeposition of crystalline, oxide free p-block metals and metalloids is described, and it is demonstrated that by combining mixtures of these reagents, this system is suitable for electrodeposition of binary semiconductor alloys. The tetrabutylammonium halometallates, [NnBu4][InCl4], [NnBu4][SbCl4], [NnBu4][BiCl4], [NnBu4]2[SeCl6] and [NnBu4]2[TeCl6], are readily dissolved in CH2Cl2 and form reproducible electrochemical systems with good stability in the presence of a [NnBu4]Cl supporting electrolyte. The prepared electrolytes show a wide potential window and the electrodeposition of indium, antimony, bismuth, tellurium and selenium on glassy carbon and titanium nitride electrodes has been demonstrated. The deposited elements were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The compatibility of the reagents permits the preparation of a single electrolyte containing several halometallate species which allows the electrodeposition of binary materials, as is demonstrated for InSb. This room temperature, `bottom-up' electrochemical approach should thus be suitable for the one-pot deposition of a wide range of compound semiconductor materials.},

The validity of the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation is demonstrated in the limit to 0 K as a result of dopant freezeout in cryogenic equilibrium. Explicit MOS transistor expressions are then derived, including incomplete dopant ionization, bandgap widening, mobility reduction, and interface charge traps. The temperature dependence of the interface trapping process explains the discrepancy between the measured value of the subthreshold swing and the thermal limit at deep-cryogenic temperatures. The accuracy of the developed model is validated by experimental results on long devices of a commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS process. The proposed model provides the core expressions for the development of physically accurate compact models dedicated to low-temperature CMOS circuit simulation.},

Care should be taken because dopant freezeout results in a different physical definition of the threshold voltage. Using different definitions changes significantly the threshold current level. The proposed model is experimentally validated with measurements in large-area nMOS and pMOS devices of a commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS process down to 4.2 K.

Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO3 and both insulating and electron-doped ATiO3 perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO3 (which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO3 and LiOsO3 emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and this mechanism is `resistant' to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising avenues for further research.},

The objective of this Review is to identify the polymorphs of emerging 2D materials, describe their polymorph-dependent properties, and outline methods used for polymorph control. Since traditional 2D materials (e.g., graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides) have already been studied extensively, the focus here is on polymorphism in post-dichalcogenide 2D materials including group III, IV, and V elemental 2D materials, layered group III, IV, and V metal chalcogenides, and 2D transition metal halides. In addition to providing a comprehensive survey of recent experimental and theoretical literature, this Review identifies the most promising opportunities for future research including how 2D polymorph engineering can provide a pathway to materials by design.},

  abstract = {The resistance of two-dimensional electron systems such as thin disordered films shows deviations from Boltzmann theory, which are caused by quantum corrections and are called weak localization. The theoretical origin of weak localization is the Langer\textendash Neal graph in Kubo formalism. It represents an interference experiment with conduction electrons split into pairs of waves interfering in the back-scattering direction. The intensity of the interference (integrated over the time) can easily be measured by the resistance of the film. The application of a magnetic field B destroys the phase coherence after a time which is proportional to 1/B. For a field of 1 T this time is of the order of 1 ps. Therefore with a dc experiment, one can measure characteristic times of the electron system in the range of picoseconds. Weak localization has been applied to measure dephasing, spin-orbit scattering, tunneling times, etc. One important field of application is the investigation of magnetic systems and magnetic impurities by measuring the magnetic dephasing time and its temperature dependence. Here the Kondo maximum of spin-flip scattering, spin-fluctuations, Fermi liquid behavior and magnetic d-resonances have been investigated. Another field is the detection of magnetic moments for very dilute alloys and surface impurities. This article given a brief survey of different applications of weak localization with a focus on magnetic impurities.}

While in the early prototyping as well as research and development phases, electrical test devices created by conventional lithography have provided adequate insights, this approach is becoming increasingly problematic due to complications such as irreversible damage to the original graphene film, contamination, and a high measurement effort per device. In this topical review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the issues that need to be addressed by any large-area characterisation method for electrical key performance indicators, with emphasis on electrical uniformity and on how this can be used to provide a more accurate analysis of the graphene film. We review and compare three different, but complementary approaches that rely either on fixed contacts (dry laser lithography), movable contacts (micro four point probes) and non-contact (terahertz time-domain spectroscopy) between the probe and the graphene film, all of which have been optimized for maximal throughput and accuracy, and minimal damage to the graphene film. Of these three, the main emphasis is on THz time-domain spectroscopy, which is non-destructive, highly accurate and allows both conductivity, carrier density and carrier mobility to be mapped across arbitrarily large areas at rates that by far exceed any other known method. We also detail how the THz conductivity spectra give insights on the scattering mechanisms, and through that, the microstructure of graphene films subject to different growth and transfer processes. The perspectives for upscaling to realistic production environments are discussed.},

Here we show the ability of morphological manipulation strategies, such as nanotexturing or, at the limit, important surface roughness, to enhance light absorption and the luminescent response of atomically thin indium selenide nanosheets. Besides, quantum-size confinement effects make this two-dimensional semiconductor to exhibit one of the largest band gap tunability ranges observed in a two-dimensional semiconductor: from infrared, in bulk material, to visible wavelengths, at the single layer.

To date, reports on the synthesis of high-quality and scalable InSe atomic films are limited. Here, a synthesis of InSe atomic layers by vapor phase selenization of In2O3 in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system, resulting in large-area monolayer flakes or thin films, is reported. The atomic films are continuous and uniform over a large area of 1 ? 1 cm2, comprising of primarily InSe monolayers. Spectroscopic and microscopic measurements reveal the highly crystalline nature of the synthesized InSe monolayers. The ion-gel-gated field-effect transistors based on CVD InSe monolayers exhibit n-type channel behaviors, where the field effect electron mobility values can be up to {$\approx$}30 cm2 V?1 s?1 along with an on/off current ratio, of {$>$}104 at room temperature. In addition, the graphene can serve as a protection layer to prevent the oxidation between InSe and the ambient environment. Meanwhile, the synthesized InSe films can be transferred to arbitrary substrates, enabling the possibility of reassembly of various 2D materials into vertically stacked heterostructures, prompting research efforts to probe its characteristics and applications.},

The vertical configuration offers the added advantage of eliminating the influence of large impedance at the band tails and allows the observation of fully excited electron states near the surface of molybdenum disulphide over a wide excitation frequency and temperature range. By combining capacitance and transport measurements, we have observed a percolation-type metal-insulator transition, driven by density inhomogeneities of electron states, in monolayer and multilayer molybdenum disulphide. In addition, the valence band of thin molybdenum disulphide layers and their intrinsic properties are accessed.},

Conventional metal oxides are widely used as resistive switching materials in memristors. Interface-type memristors based on ferroelectric materials are emerging as alternatives in the development of high-performance memory devices. A clear understanding of the switching mechanisms in this type of memristors, however, is still in its early stages. By comparing the bipolar switching in different systems, it is found that the switchable diode effect in ferroelectric memristors is controlled by polarization modulated Schottky barrier height and polarization coupled interfacial deep states trapping/detrapping. Using semiconductor theories with consideration of polarization effects, a phenomenological theory is developed to explain the current?voltage behavior at the metal/ferroelectric interface. These findings reveal the critical role of the interaction among polarization charges, interfacial defects, and Schottky interface in controlling ferroelectric resistive switching and offer the guidance to design ferroelectric memristors with enhanced performance.},

To implement In2Se3 in nanoscale ferroelectric devices, an understanding of the domain structure and switching dynamics in the 2D limit is essential. In this study, a biased scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) tip is used to locally switch polarized domains in ??-In2Se3, and the reconfiguration of these domains are directly visualized using STM. The room-temperature surface of ??-In2Se3 breaks into 1D nanostriped domains, which changes into a zig-zag striped domains of ?? phase at low temperatures. These two types of domains can coexist, and by applying a tip-sample bias, they can be interchangeably switched locally, showing volatile or nonvolatile like behavior depending on the threshold voltage applied. An atomic model is proposed to explain the switching mechanism based on tip-induced flexoelectric effect and the ferroelastic switching between ?? and ?? phases.},

Here we show that an asymmetric van der Waals heterostructure device, which is composed of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and molybdenum ditelluride, can function as a high-performance diode, transistor, photodetector and programmable rectifier. Due to the asymmetric structure of the device, charge-carrier injection can be switched between tunnelling and thermal activation under negative and positive bias conditions, respectively. As a result, the device exhibits a high current on/off ratio of 6\,\texttimes\,108 and a rectifying ratio of \textasciitilde 108.

Fabricating planar As2S3 waveguides, however, is not straightforward because As2S3 is dissolved in alkalis such as photo-resist developer. In this study we present the application of thin SU-8 film as a protective layer to prevent the attack of the developer on the As2S3 during photolithographic process. Despite excellent coating feature and simple process of SU-8 as a protective layer, the delamination between SU-8 and polymer cladding during chip cleaving hindered its application. We deposited thin Al2O3 on SU-8 by atomic layer deposition and this intermediate layer could solve the problem. We measured the insertion losses of fabricated waveguides as a function of device lengths and widths. The propagation loss becomes significant in a narrow guide due to the enhanced surface scattering. It was clear that extra losses were engaged in long guides containing bending structures. SU-8 layer and thin Al2O3 combination allowed reliable and repeatable fabrication process in that it did not induce any extra light scattering or absorption and prevented attack of the As2S3 film by the alkaline developer. Moreover, the device characterisation revealed that SU-8 layer is superior to PMMA/BARC in terms of propagation loss of waveguide (\textcopyright{} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

From density functional theory calculations, ? and ? phases, characterized by octahedral bonding with vdW gaps and tetrahedral bonding without vdW gaps, respectively, are shown to have energy bandgap value of 0.78 and 1.86 eV, consistent with a metal-to-insulator transition accompanying the ?-to-? phase change. The monolithic In2Se3 layered film reported here provides a novel means to achieving a PCM based on melting-free, low-entropy phase changes in contrast with the GeTe?Sb2Te3 superlattice film adopted in interfacial phase-change memory.},

Of particular interest was a broad emission band centered at 3.4\,eV, with a FWHM of 200\,meV, which extends above the bandgap of both zincblende and wurtzite GaN. Photoluminescence excitation measurements show that this band is associated with an absorption edge centered at 3.6\,eV. Photoluminescence time decays for the band are monoexponential, with lifetimes that reduce from 0.67\,ns to 0.15\,ns as the recombination energy increases. TEM measurements show no evidence of wurtzite GaN inclusions which are typically used to explain emission in this energy range. However, dense stacking fault bunches are present in the epilayers. A model for the band alignment at the stacking faults was developed to explain this emission band, showing how both electrons and holes can be confined adjacent to stacking faults. Different stacking fault separations can change the carrier confinement energies sufficiently to explain the width of the emission band, and change the carrier wavefunction overlap to account for the variation in decay time.}

Voltage-modulated atomic force microscopy (VM-AFM) has become a mainstay characterization tool for investigating these materials due to its ability to locally probe electromechanically responsive materials with spatial resolution from micrometers to nanometers. However, with the wide popularity of VM-AFM techniques such as piezoresponse force microscopy and electrochemical strain microscopy there has been a rise in reports of nanoscale electromechanical functionality, including hysteresis, in materials that should be incapable of exhibiting piezo- or ferroelectricity. Explanations for the origins of unexpected nanoscale phenomena have included new material properties, surface-mediated polarization changes, and/or spatially resolved behavior that is not present in bulk measurements. At the same time, it is well known that VM-AFM measurements are susceptible to numerous forms of crosstalk, and, despite efforts within the AFM community, a global approach for eliminating this has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a method for easily demonstrating the presence of hysteretic (i.e., ``false ferroelectric'') long-range interactions between the sample and cantilever body. This method should be easy to implement in any VM-AFM measurement. We then go on to demonstrate fully quantitative and repeatable nanoelectromechanical characterization using an interferometer.

In agreement with DFT, we find the band structure is highly two-dimensional, with negligible dispersion along the c-axis. Because of n-type doping we can observe the conduction band minima and directly measure the minimum indirect (0.97 eV) and direct (1.46 eV) bandgaps. We find the Fermi surface in the conduction band is characterized by anisotropic electron pockets with sharp in-plane dispersion about the {$\overline M$} points, yielding effective masses of 0.21m0 along KM and 0.33m0 along {$\Gamma$}M. The measured band structure is well supported by hybrid density functional theory calculations. The highly two-dimensional (2D) band structure with moderate bandgap and small effective mass suggests that {$\beta{'}$}-In2Se3 is a potentially useful van der Waals semiconductor.

In this work, we demonstrate that, unlike 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides, {$\gamma$}-phase InSe with a hexagonal unit cell possesses broken inversion symmetry in all the layer numbers and has a strong second-harmonic generation effect. Moreover, driven by the piezo-phototronic effect, a flexible self-powered photodetector based on multilayer {$\gamma$}-InSe, which can work without any energy supply, is proposed. The device exhibited ultrahigh photon responsivity of 824 mA/W under light illuminations of 400 nm (0.368 mW/cm2). Moreover, the responsivity and response speed of this photodetector were enhanced further by as much as 696\% and 1010\%, respectively, when a 0.62\% uniaxial tensile strain was applied. Our devices exhibit high reliability and stability during a 6 month test time.

  abstract = {Piezoelectric two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdWs) materials are highly desirable for applications in miniaturized and flexible/wearable devices. However, the reverse-polarization between adjacent layers in current 2D layered materials results in decreasing their in-plane piezoelectric coefficients with layer number, which limits their practical applications. Here, we report a class of 2D layered materials with an identical orientation of in-plane polarization. Their piezoelectric coefficients (e22) increase with layer number, thereby allowing for the fabrication of flexible piezotronic devices with large piezoelectric responsivity and excellent mechanical durability. The piezoelectric outputs can reach up to 0.363 V for a 7-layer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 device, with a current responsivity of 598.1 pA for 1\% strain, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than the values of the reported 2D piezoelectrics. The self-powered piezoelectric sensors made of these newly developed 2D layered materials have been successfully used for real-time health monitoring, proving their suitability for the fabrication of flexible piezotronic devices due to their large piezoelectric responses and excellent mechanical durability.},

  abstract = {Abstract Miniaturization of device elements, such as ferroelectric diodes, depends on the downscaling of ferroelectric film, which is also crucial for developing high-density information storage technologies of ferroelectric random access memories (FeRAMs). Recently emerged ferroelectric two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdWs) layered materials bring an additional opportunity to further increase the density of FeRAMs. A lateral, switchable rectifier is designed and fabricated based on atomically thin 2D {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 ferroelectric diodes, thus breaking the thickness limitation of conventional ferroelectric films and achieving an unprecedented level of miniaturization. This is realized through the interrelated coupling between out-of-plane and in-plane dipoles at room temperature; that is, horizontal polarization reversal can be effectively controlled through a vertical electric field. Being further explored as a switchable rectifier, the obtained maximum value of rectification ratio for the {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 based ferroelectric diode can reach up to 2.5 ? 103. These results indicate that 2D ferroelectric semiconductors can offer a pathway to develop next-generation multifunctional electronics.},

Here we demonstrate a simple pulsed measurement technique which reduces this hysteretic behavior, enabling more accurate characterization of 2D transistors. We compare hysteresis and charge trapping in four types of devices fabricated from both exfoliated and synthetic MoS2, with SiO2 and HfO2 insulators, using DC and pulsed voltage measurements at different temperatures. Applying modest voltage pulses ( 1 ms) on the gate significantly reduces charge trapping and results in the elimination of over 80\% of hysteresis for all devices. At shorter pulse widths ( 1 \textmu s), up to 99\% of hysteresis is reduced for some devices. Our measurements enable the extraction of a unique value of field-effect mobility, regardless of voltage sweep direction, unlike measurements that rely on forward or backward DC measurements. This simple and reproducible technique is useful for studying the intrinsic properties of 2D transistors, and can be similarly applied to other nanoscale and emerging devices where charge trapping is of concern.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear optics is an essential component of modern laser systems and optoelectronic devices. It has also emerged as an important tool in probing the electronic, vibrational, magnetic, and crystallographic structure of materials ranging from oxides and metals, to polymers and biological samples. This review focuses on the specific technique of optical second harmonic generation (SHG), and its application in probing ferroelectric complex oxide crystals and thin films. As the dominant SHG interaction mechanism exists only in materials that lack inversion symmetry, SHG is a sensitive probe of broken inversion symmetry, and thus also of bulk polar phenomena in materials. By performing in-situ SHG polarimetry experiments in different experimental conditions such as sample orientation, applied electric field, and temperature, one can probe ferroelectric hysteresis loops and phase transitions. Careful modeling of the polarimetry data allows for the determination of the point group symmetry of the crystal. In epitaxial thin films with a two-dimensional arrangement of well-defined domain orientations, one can extract information about intrinsic material properties such as nonlinear coefficients, as well as microstructural information such as the local statistics of the different domain variants being probed. This review presents several detailed examples of ferroelectric systems where such measurements and modeling are performed. The use of SHG microscopic imaging is discussed, and its ability to reveal domain structures and phases not normally visible with linear optics is illustrated.},

This work presents results from in situ conductance measurements at thicknesses from sub-nm to around 250\,nm with parallel X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. An enhanced conductivity at low thickness is explained by the occurrence of Cu(II), which is segregated in the grain boundary and locally causes a conductivity similar to CuO, although the surface of the thick film has Cu2O stoichiometry. Since grains grow with an increasing film thickness, the effect of an apparent oxygen excess is most pronounced in vicinity to the substrate interface. Electrical properties of Cu2O grains are at least partially short-circuited by this effect. The study focuses on properties inherent to copper oxide, although interface effects cannot be ruled out. This non-destructive, bottom-up analysis reveals phenomena which are commonly not observable after device fabrication, but clearly dominate electrical properties of polycrystalline thin films.}

In this context, the understanding of the graphene/semiconductor interface is of great importance since it can constitute a versatile standalone device as well as the building-block of more advanced electronic systems. Since graphene was brought to the attention of the scientific community in 2004, the device research has been focused on the more complex graphene transistors, while the graphene/semiconductor junction, despite its importance, has started to be the subject of systematic investigation only recently. As a result, a thorough understanding of the physics and the potentialities of this device is still missing. The studies of the past few years have demonstrated that graphene can form junctions with 3D or 2D semiconducting materials which have rectifying characteristics and behave as excellent Schottky diodes. The main novelty of these devices is the tunable Schottky barrier height, a feature which makes the graphene/semiconductor junction a great platform for the study of interface transport mechanisms as well as for applications in photo-detection, high-speed communications, solar cells, chemical and biological sensing, etc. In this paper, we review the state-of-the art of the research on graphene/semiconductor junctions, the attempts towards a modeling and the most promising applications.},

So far, most existing FTJs have been based on perovskite-oxide barrier layers. The recent discovery of the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferroelectric materials opens a new route to realize tunnel junctions with new functionalities and nm-scale dimensions. Because of the weak coupling between the atomic layers in these materials, the relative dipole alignment between them can be controlled by applied voltage. This allows transitions between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orderings, resulting in significant changes of the electronic structure. Here, we propose to realize 2D antiferroelectric tunnel junctions (AFTJs), which exploit this new functionality, based on bilayer In2X3 (X=S, Se, Te) barriers and different 2D electrodes. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the In2X3 bilayers exhibit stable ferroelectric and antiferroelectric states separated by sizable energy barriers, thus supporting a nonvolatile switching between these states. Using quantum-mechanical modeling of the electronic transport, we explore in-plane and out-of-plane tunneling across the In2S3 van der Waals bilayers, and predict giant tunneling electroresistance effects and multiple nonvolatile resistance states driven by ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order transitions. Our proposal opens a new route to realize nanoscale memory devices with ultrahigh storage density using 2D AFTJs.},

When compared to the related ammonolysis reactions of cubic GaP and cubic GaSb which yielded, respectively, either the hexagonal polytype only or mixtures of mostly hexagonal with some cubic GaN polytypes, here, the nitride could be made both as solely hexagonal and as a mixture of two polytypes in a wide composition range. All this supports diverse reaction pathways which were found to be closely correlated with substrate grain size characteristics.

  abstract = {Abstract Various ferroelectric simulation models have been developed in recent decades in order to study the mechanisms and predict the behaviors of ferroelectrics by simulating their hysteresis loops. Conventional ferroelectrics have wide optical band gaps ({$>$}2.7~eV), making them difficult to respond to visible light. Although their ferroelectricity can be affected by higher-energy radiation like ultraviolet, little attention is paid to the development of their models incorporating light-dependent factors. However, in recent years, narrow band gap ({$<$}2.5~eV) ferroelectrics have been discovered and are increasingly researched. These special ferroelectrics effectively absorb visible light and hence exhibit strongly light-dependent ferroelectricity, triggering potentially a broad range of applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a model for these ferroelectrics in order to predict their behavior under visible light. Such a model is also needed to improve the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between light and domains. In this paper, a ferroelectric simulation model based on the Jiles?Atherton theory considering light dependence is developed for the first time, and its accuracy is validated by experiments. The model shows an average error of 7.5\% on polarization values compared to experimental results and thus can be employed to reliably predict photo-induced ferroelectricity.},

Using low temperature piezoresponse force microscopy, we revealed coexistence of piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric phases in CuInP2Se6, forming unusual domain walls with enhanced piezoelectric response. From systematic imaging experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries. The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and density-functional-theory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the existing phenomenology of functional domain walls. At the same time, phase-coexistence in chalcogenophosphates may lead to rational strategies for incorporation of ferroic functionality into van der Waals heterostructures, with stronger resilience toward detrimental size-effects.},

The voltage distributions along the M-S-M structure were numerically determined and found that the voltage drop across the reverse-biased Schottky barrier is dominating at the low bias voltage, and the dominant range depends on the value of the resistor of the semiconductor bulk. The field dependence of barrier height due to the image force was proposed to be the mechanism for the current through the M-S-M structure when the voltage drop across the reverse-biased barrier is dominating. The proposed model was applied to the I\textendash V curves measured at different temperatures on low-resistivity p-type CdTe with Au contacts and the density of the effective acceptors calculated, and the zero-field Schottky barrier height and the Richardson constant were extracted using the activation energy method. The extracted parameters fitted well with that published for the same material structure.},

In negatively poled BFSO films, constructive photovoltaic effects at both the bulk and the BFSO/LNO interface lead to a large Voc up to 0.6V and a 5-fold enhancement in efficiency compared with conventional BFO films. In addition, ferroelectric polarization modulation of the Schottky barrier height at the BFSO/LNO interface results in a conversion between Schottky and Ohmic conduction, which gives rise to switchable high- and low-resistance states. The present work demonstrates a strategy effective to realize ferroelectric-based thin film structure with enhanced photovoltaic effects and memory function.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric diodes with polarization-modulated Schottky barriers are promising for applications in resistive switching (RS) memories. However, they have not achieved satisfactory performance reliability as originally hoped. The physical origins underlying this issue have not been well studied, although they deserve much attention. Here, by means of scanning Kelvin probe microscopy we show that the electrical poling of ferroelectric diodes can cause significant charge injection and trapping besides polarization switching. We further show that the reproducibility and stability of switchable diode-type RS behavior are significantly affected by the interfacial traps. A theoretical model is then proposed to quantitatively describe the modifications of Schottky barriers by charge injection and trapping. This model is able to reproduce various types of hysteretic current-voltage characteristics as experimentally observed. It is further revealed that the charge injection and trapping can significantly modify the electroresistance ratio, RS polarity, and high- or low-resistance states initially defined by the polarization direction. Several approaches are suggested to suppress the effect of charge injection and trapping so as to realize high-performance polarization-reversal-induced RS. This study, therefore, reveals the microscopic mechanisms for the RS behavior comodulated by polarization reversal and charge trapping in ferroelectric diodes, and also provides useful suggestions for developing reliable ferroelectric RS memories.},

Here, we report growth of large-scale 2D In2Se3 nanosheets by templated chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, using In2O3 and Se powders as precursors. The strain sensors fabricated from the as-grown 2D In2Se3 films show 2 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity (gauge factor {$\sim$}237 in -0.39\% to 0.39\% uniaxial strain range along the device channel length) than what has been demonstrated from conventional metal-based (gauge factor: {$\sim$}1\textendash 5) and graphene-based strain sensors (gauge factor: {$\sim$}2\textendash 4) in a similar uniaxial strain range. The integrated strain sensor array, fabricated from the template-grown 2D In2Se3 films, exhibits a high spatial resolution of {$\sim$}500 {$\mu$}m in strain distribution.

These lead to an original regime of transport called transient localization, sharing features of both localized and itinerant electron systems. After a brief review of experimental observations that pose a challenge to the theory, we concentrate on a commonly studied model which describes the interaction of the charge carriers with intermolecular vibrations. We present different theoretical approaches that have been applied to the problem in the past, and then turn to more modern approaches that are able to capture the key microscopic phenomenon at the origin of the puzzling experimental observations, i.e., the quantum localization of the electronic wavefunction at timescales shorter than the typical molecular motions. We describe in particular a relaxation time approximation which clarifies how the transient localization due to dynamical molecular motions relates to the Anderson localization realized for static disorder, and allows us to devise strategies to improve the mobility of actual compounds. The relevance of the transient localization scenario to other classes of systems is briefly discussed.},

Moreover, these deterministic placement methods also open the door to fabricate complex devices, which would be otherwise very difficult to achieve by conventional bottom-up nanofabrication approaches, and to fabricate fully-encapsulated devices with exquisite electronic properties. The integration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and superconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of the deterministic placement methods, describing and comparing the different alternative methods available in the literature, and we illustrate their potential to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures, to integrate 2D materials into complex devices and to fabricate artificial bilayer structures where the layers present a user-defined rotational twisting angle.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ferroelectric memristors represent a promising new generation of devices that have a wide range of applications in memory, digital information processing, and neuromorphic computing. Recently, van der Waals ferroelectric In2Se3 with unique interlinked out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations has enabled multidirectional resistance switching, providing unprecedented flexibility in planar and vertical device integrations. However, the operating mechanisms of these devices have remained unclear. Here, through the demonstration of van der Waals In2Se3-based planar ferroelectric memristors with the device resistance continuously tunable over three orders of magnitude, and by correlating device resistance states, ferroelectric domain configurations, and surface electric potential, the studies reveal that the resistive switching is controlled by the multidomain formations and the associated energy barriers between domains, as opposed to the commonly assumed Schottky barrier modulations at the metal-ferroelectric interface. The findings reveal new device physics through elucidating the microscopic operating mechanisms of this new generation of devices, and provide a critical guide for future device development and integration efforts.},

  abstract = {Water-related redox couples in ambient air are identified as an important source of the surface trapping states, dynamic on-resistance, and drain current collapse in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). Through in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), direct signature of the water-related species\textemdash hydroxyl groups (OH) was found at the AlGaN surface at room temperature. It was also found that these species, as well as the current collapse, can be thermally removed above 200\,\textdegree C in vacuum conditions. An electron trapping mechanism based on the H2O/H2 and H2O/O2 redox couples is proposed to explain the 0.5\,eV energy level commonly attributed to the surface trapping states. Finally, the role of silicon nitride passivation in successfully removing current collapse in these devices is explained by blocking the water molecules away from the AlGaN surface.}

Ferroelectric materials are promising candidates as synaptic weight elements in neural network hardware due to their controllable polarization states.

Here,~we report the implementation of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric~{$\alpha$}-In2Se3 as an active channel material to emulate typical synaptic functions. The {$\alpha$}-In2Se3-based synaptic device features multimode operations, enabled by the coupled ferroelectric polarization under various voltage pulses applied at both drain~and gate terminals. Moreover, the energy consumption can be reduced to \textasciitilde{} 1?pJ by using high-? dielectric (Al2O3).

However, separating ferroelectric effect from many of the factors (such as charge injection/trapping and the presence of mobile ions in the polymer) that confound interpretation is still confusing and controversial. This work presents a methodology to reliably identify the confounding factors which obscure the polarization effect in FeFETs. Careful observation of the Id?Vg curves, as well as monitoring the Id?Vg hysteresis and flat band voltage shift as a function of temperature and sweep frequency, identifies the dominant mechanism. This methodology is demonstrated by using 15 nm thick high glass transition temperature polar polymer-based FeFETs. In these devices, room temperature hysteresis is largely a consequence of charge trapping and mobile ions, while ferroelectric polarization is observed at elevated temperatures. This methodology can be used to unambiguously prove the effect of ferroelectric polarization in FeFETs.},

Except for the p-type Schottky contact with platinum, the Fermi levels in all of the studied metal\textendash MoS2 complexes are situated above the midgap of MoS2. The mechanism of the Fermi level pinning at metal\textendash MoS2 contact is shown to be unique for metal\textendash 2D-semiconductor interfaces, remarkably different from the well-known Bardeen pinning effect, metal-induced gap states, and defect/disorder induced gap states, which are applicable to traditional metal\textendash semiconductor junctions. At metal\textendash MoS2 interfaces, the Fermi level is partially pinned as a result of two interface behaviors: first by a metal work function modification by interface dipole formation due to the charge redistribution, and second by the production of gap states mainly of Mo d-orbitals character by the weakened intralayer S\textendash Mo bonding due to the interface metal\textendash S interaction. This finding would provide guidance to develop approaches to form Ohmic contact to MoS2.}

Mobility directly influences electrical conductivity and its dependence on the carrier density. But linking these key transport parameters remains a challenging task for both theorists and experimentalists. Here, we report numerical and analytical models of carrier transport in graphene, which reveal a universal connection between graphene's carrier mobility and the variation of its electrical conductivity with carrier density. Our model of graphene conductivity is based on a convolution of carrier density and its uncertainty, which is verified by numerical solution of the Boltzmann transport equation including the effects of charged impurity scattering and optical phonons on the carrier mobility. This model reproduces, explains, and unifies experimental mobility and conductivity data from a wide range of samples and provides a way to predict a priori all key transport parameters of graphene devices. Our results open a route for controlling the transport properties of graphene by doping and for engineering the properties of 2D materials and heterostructures.},

Devices constructed of these 2D materials could be sensitively affected by ambient gases, such as O2 molecules. Regarding this significant issue, here we review the oxidation behaviors of 2D metal chalcogenides, especially for perfect and defective monolayers. Perfect monolayer metal chalcogenides are resistant to oxidation, resulting from the large activation energies for chemisorption and dissociation of O2 molecules during the reaction process. However, the defective monolayers with vacancies are prone to be oxidized with small activation energies. Interestingly, oxygen atoms can fill into the chalcogen vacancy sites and further maintian the electronic band structures of the perfect systems ? the band gaps and the carrier effective masses are only moderately modified by the oxygen atoms. These fundamental understandings help to improve the use of monolayer metal chalcogenides toward the development of novel 2D devices with high stability and excellent performance.},

  abstract = {The weak intermolecular interactions inherent in organic semiconductors make them susceptible to defect formation, resulting in localized states in the band-gap that can trap charge carriers at different timescales. Charge carrier trapping is thus ubiquitous in organic semiconductors and can have a profound impact on their performance when incorporated into optoelectronic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the phenomenon of charge carrier trapping in organic semiconductors, with emphasis on the underlying physical processes and its impact on device operation. We first define the concept of charge carrier trap, then outline and categorize different origins of traps. Next, we discuss their impact on the mechanism of charge transport and the performance of electronic devices. Progress in the filed in terms of characterization and detection of charge carrier traps is reviewed together with insights on future direction of research. Finally, a discussion on the exploitation of traps in memory and sensing applications is provided.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional material indium selenide (InSe) has offered a new platform for fundamental research in virtue of its emerging fascinating properties. Unlike 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), {$\epsilon$} phase InSe with a hexagonal unit cell possesses broken inversion symmetry in all the layer numbers, and predicted to have a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect. In this work, we find that the as-prepared pure InSe, alloyed InSe1\textendash xTex and InSe1\textendash xSx (x = 0.1 and 0.2) are {$\epsilon$} phase structures and exhibit excellent SHG performance from few-layer to bulk-like dimension. This high SHG efficiency is attributed to the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of the {$\epsilon$}-InSe system, which has been clearly verified by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The experimental results show that the SHG intensities from multilayer pure {$\epsilon$}-InSe and alloyed InSe0.9Te0.1 and InSe1\textendash xSx (x = 0.1 and 0.2) are around 1\textendash 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the monolayer TMD systems and even superior to that of GaSe with the same thickness. The estimated nonlinear susceptibility {$\chi$}(2) of {$\epsilon$}-InSe is larger than that of {$\epsilon$}-GaSe and monolayer TMDs. Our study provides first-hand information about the phase identification of {$\epsilon$}-InSe and indicates an excellent candidate for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications as well as the possibility of engineering SHG response by alloying.},

  abstract = {Indium selenide (InSe) has become a research hotspot because of its favorable carrier mobility and thickness-tunable band gap, showing great application potential in high-performance optoelectronic devices. The trend of miniaturization in optoelectronics has forced the feature sizes of the electronic components to shrink accordingly. Therefore, atomically thin InSe crystals may play an important role in future optoelectronics. Given the instability and ultralow photoluminescent (PL) emission of mechanically exfoliated ultrathin InSe, synthesis of highly stable mono- and few-layer InSe nanosheets with high PL efficiency has become crucial. Herein, ultrathin InSe nanosheets were prepared via thermal annealing of electrochemically intercalated products from bulk InSe. The size and yield of the as-prepared nanosheets were up to {$\sim$}160 {$\mu$}m and {$\sim$}70\%, respectively, and {$\sim$}80\% of the nanosheets were less than five layer. Impressively, the as-prepared nanosheets showed greatly enhanced stability and PL emission because of surface modification by carbon species. Efficient photoresponsivity of 2 A/W was achieved in the as-prepared nanosheet-based devices. These nanosheets were further assembled into large-area thin films with photoresponsivity of 16 A/W and an average Hall mobility of about 5 cm2 V\textendash 1 s\textendash 1. Finally, one-dimensional (1D) InSe nanoscrolls with a length up to 90 {$\mu$}m were constructed by solvent-assisted self-assembly of the exfoliated nanosheets.},

Although several accomplishments have been reported in ferroelectric switching for out-of-plane ferroelectrics down to the monolayer, a purely in-plane ferroelectric has not been experimentally validated at the monolayer thickness. Herein, an in-plane ferroelectricity is demonstrated for micrometer-size monolayer SnS at room temperature. SnS has been commonly regarded to exhibit the odd\textendash even effect, where the centrosymmetry breaks only in the odd-number layers to exhibit ferroelectricity. Remarkably, however, a robust room temperature ferroelectricity exists in SnS below a critical thickness of 15 layers with both an odd and even number of layers, suggesting the possibility of controlling the stacking sequence of multilayer SnS beyond the limit of ferroelectricity in the monolayer. This work will pave the way for nanoscale ferroelectric applications based on SnS as a platform for in-plane ferroelectrics.},

For this reason, piezoelectric devices are already ubiquitous, including, for instance, quartz oscillators, mechanical actuators with sub-atomic resolution and microbalances. However, the ability to synthesize two-dimensional (2D) materials may enable the fabrication of innovative devices with unprecedented performance. For instance, many materials which are not piezoelectric in their bulk form become piezoelectric when reduced to a single atomic layer; moreover, since all the atoms belong to the surface, piezoelectricity can be effectively engineered by proper surface modifications. As additional advantages, 2D materials are strong, flexible, easy to be co-integrated with conventional integrated circuits or micro-electromechanical systems and, in comparison with bulk or quasi-1D materials, easier to be simulated at the atomistic level. Here, we review the state of the art on 2D piezoelectricity, with reference to both computational predictions and experimental characterization. Because of their unique advantages, we believe 2D piezoelectric materials will substantially expand the applications of piezoelectricity.},

  abstract = {In search of high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) made of atomic thin semiconductors, indium selenide (InSe) has held great promise because of its high intrinsic mobility and moderate electronic band gap (1.26 eV). Yet the performance of InSe FETs is decisively determined by the surface oxidation of InSe taking place spontaneously in ambient conditions, setting up a mobility ceiling and causing an uncontrollable current hysteresis. Encapsulation by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been currently used to cope with this deterioration. Here, we provide insights into the role of surface oxides played in device performance and introduce a dry-oxidation process that forms a dense capping layer on top, where InSe FETs exhibit a record-high two-probe mobility of 423 cm2/V{$\cdot$}s at room temperature and 1006 cm2/V{$\cdot$}s at liquid nitrogen temperature without the use of h-BN encapsulation or high-{$\kappa$} dielectric screening. Ultrahigh on/off current ratio of {$>$}108 and current density of 365 {$\mu$}A/{$\mu$}m can be readily achieved without elaborate engineering of drain/source contacts or gating technique. Thickness-dependent device properties are also studied, with optimized performance shown in FETs comprising of 13 nm thick InSe. The high performance of InSe FETs with ultrathin dry oxide is attributed to the effective unpinning of the Fermi level at the metal contacts, resulting in a low Schottky barrier height of 40 meV in an optimized channel thickness.},

  abstract = {Controllably selective growth of two-dimensional (2D) layered single crystals plays an important role for their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Among these 2D materials, indium selenide (InxSey), especially InSe and In2Se3, are typical III-VI compound semiconductors which have attracted particular attention due to their excellent electronic transport properties, photoresponse and nonlinear effect. However, controllably selective growth of 2D InSe and In2Se3 by a common method is still a great challenge due to the existence of various stoichiometric substances and crystalline phases of each substance in the indium selenide system. Here, we demonstrate a temperature-dependent chemical vapor transport (CVT) strategy to synthesize few-layer {$\beta$}-InSe and {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 single crystals at 400 \textdegree C and 450 \textdegree C on mica substrate, respectively. A few-layer {$\beta$}-InSe photodetector was fabricated, which displayed high sensitivity to a broad photoresponse range from visible light (500 nm) to near infrared light (850 nm) with a high responsivity of 2103 A W-1 and detectivity of 4.25 \texttimes{} 1012 Jones illuminated by 500 nm. Moreover, we first demonstrate the piezo-phototronic effect of 2D {$\alpha$}-In2Se3. The photodetection performance of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 photodetector was increased by 35\% with a uniaxial tensile strain of 0.44\% under 700 nm light. Our work demonstrates that few-layer {$\beta$}-InSe and {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 single crystals can not only be synthesized selectively, but also exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties, which paves a way for their application in optoelectronic and flexible devices.},

However, this transition usually faces the challenge of strong Fermi level pinning effect at heterointerface. Herein, we employ density functional theory to explore the interface contact properties in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3/1T-MX2 (M~=~Mn, V, Cr; X~=~Se, Te) vdW heterojunctions, where {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 has two opposite polarization states ({$\alpha$}-P{$\uparrow$} and {$\alpha$}-P{$\downarrow$}). We find that only the case of 1T-MnSe2 maintains the initial crystal structure with being affected by electrical polarization of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3. Moreover, {$\alpha$}-In2Se3/1T-MnSe2 shows an enhanced p-type Schottky barrier in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 with {$\alpha$}-P{$\uparrow$} state, while it can exhibit n-type Ohmic contact when {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 reverses to {$\alpha$}-P{$\downarrow$} state. Further kinetic analysis reveals that this transition is non-volatile and intrinsic. Our results provide an avenue for the design of future 2D non-volatile electronics.},

  abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of {$\sim$}4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.}

Despite current progress, the synthesis of ultrathin InSe nanoflakes still poses quite a challenge, due to its universal co-existing varied stoichiometric compounds. In this work, a novel phase-engineered route is proposed for synthesizing ultrathin single-crystalline InSe nanoflakes with the assistance of a stable mass-transfer process in a space-confined chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. By finely tuning the growth parameters, InSe can be obtained through engineering a phase-transition thereby eliminating the undesirable In2Se3 phase, revealed by the synergistic effect of high-content H2 and deficient Se. Furthermore, owing to the non-centrosymmetric structure, the CVD-grown InSe nanoflakes exhibit a high-performance second harmonic generation (SHG), making it very promising for future SHG applications in 2D configurations. This approach paves the way for the synthesis of other similar ultrathin materials with multiphase homologous compounds.},

Here we report on photodetectors incorporating the layered material In2Se3, which allow complete modulation of a high gain, photogating mechanism in the ON state in favor of fast photoconduction in the OFF state. While photoconduction is largely gate independent, photocurrent from the photogating effect is strongly modulated through application of a back gate voltage. By varying the back gate, we demonstrate control over the dominant mechanism responsible for photocurrent generation. Furthermore, because of the strong photogating effect, these direct-band gap, multilayer phototransistors produce ultrahigh gains of (9.8 {$\pm$} 2.5) \texttimes{} 104 A/W and inferred detectivities of (3.3 {$\pm$} 0.8) \texttimes{} 1013 Jones, putting In2Se3 among the most sensitive 2D materials for photodetection studied to date.},

Since this process requires time-consuming and error-prone manual assignment to avoid false-positives from image features with similar contrast, efforts towards fast and reliable automated assignments schemes is essential. We show that by modelling the expected 2DM contrast in digitally captured images, we can automatically identify candidate regions of 2DM. More importantly, we show a computationally-light machine vision strategy for eliminating false-positives from this set of 2DM candidates through the combined use of binary thresholding, opening and closing filters, and shape-analysis from edge detection. Calculation of data pyramids for arbitrarily high-resolution optical coverage maps of two-dimensional materials produced in this way allows the real-time presentation and processing of this image data in a zoomable interface, enabling large datasets to be explored and analysed with ease. The result is that a standard optical microscope with CCD camera can be used as an analysis tool able to accurately determine the coverage, residue/contamination concentration, and layer number for a wide range of presented 2DMs.},

Some work has been performed to improve the mobility of InSe FETs. However, in practical applications, electrical stability of FETs is another essential factor to guarantee the performance of the electronic system. Here, we show a highly stable InSe FET with a field-effect mobility of 1200\,cm2/V{$\cdot$}s in the practical working regime. The bottom-gate staggered InSe FET was fabricated with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/HfO2 dual-layer gate dielectric and PMMA back-channel encapsulation. The hysteresis was maintained at 0.4\,V after 30 days of storage under normal ambient conditions, and the threshold voltage shift was retained at 0.6\,V with a gate stress VGS of 10\,V, which represents the best electrical stability reported to date. Its high mobility and electrical stability enable reliable detection of the weak nerve action potential at a low power consumption. High-performance InSe FETs expand their promising applications in flexible and in situ real-time intelligent nerve action potential recording.},

The dynamic FE model is applied to an FE-dielectric (FE-DE) series capacitor as well as FeFET after calibration and verification by transient measurement of an FE-HfO2 capacitor. By investigating current through the FE-DE series capacitor and the gate capacitor of FeFET, we find that incomplete screening of spontaneous polarization charge results in transient NC and sub-60 mV/dec SS. Also, it should be noted that, for FeFET, small depletion layer capacitance has an important role to cause strong depolarization effect and thus steep SS. Moreover, reverse drain induced barrier lowering happens even with this FE model. The model presented in this paper provides a reasonable interpretation for the previously reported steep SS of NC FETs.},

It has been suggested by Anderson and Blount [P. W. Anderson, E. I. Blount, \emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} 14, 217-219 (1965)] that a transition from paraelectric phase to FE phase is possible for a metal if, in the paraelectric phase, the electrons at the Fermi level are decoupled from the soft transverse optical phonons, which lead to ferroelectricity. Here, using Raman spectroscopy combined with magnetotransport measurements on a recently discovered FE metal LiOsO\textsubscript{3}, we demonstrate active interplay of itinerant electrons and the FE order: Itinerant electrons cause strong renormalization of the FE order parameter, leading to a more gradual transition in LiOsO\textsubscript{3} than typical insulating FEs. In return, the FE order enhances the anisotropy of charge transport between parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction. The temperature-dependent evolution of Raman active in-plane \textsuperscript{3}E\textsubscript{g} phonon, which strongly couples to the polar-active out-of-the-plane A\textsubscript{2u} phonon mode in the high-temperature paraelectric state, exhibits a deviation in Raman shift from the expectation of the pseudospin-phonon model that is widely used to model many insulating FEs. The Curie-Weiss temperature (\texttheta{} {$\approx$} 97 K) obtained from the optical susceptibility is substantially lower than \emph{T}\textsubscript{s}, suggesting a strong suppression of FE fluctuations. Both line width and Fano line shape of \textsuperscript{3}E\textsubscript{g} Raman mode exhibit a strong electron-phonon coupling in the high-temperature paraelectric phase, which disappears in the FE phase, challenging Anderson/Blount's proposal for the formation of FE metals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {For over 70 years, ferroelectric materials have been one of the central research topics for condensed matter physics and material science, an interest driven both by fundamental science and applications. However, ferroelectric surfaces, the key component of ferroelectric films and nanostructures, still present a significant theoretical and even conceptual challenge. Indeed, stability of ferroelectric phase per se necessitates screening of polarization charge. At surfaces, this can lead to coupling between ferroelectric and semiconducting properties of material, or with surface (electro) chemistry, going well beyond classical models applicable for ferroelectric interfaces. In this review, we summarize recent studies of surface-screening phenomena in ferroelectrics. We provide a brief overview of the historical understanding of the physics of ferroelectric surfaces, and existing theoretical models that both introduce screening mechanisms and explore the relationship between screening and relevant aspects of ferroelectric functionalities starting from phase stability itself. Given that the majority of ferroelectrics exist in multiple-domain states, we focus on local studies of screening phenomena using scanning probe microscopy techniques. We discuss recent studies of static and dynamic phenomena on ferroelectric surfaces, as well as phenomena observed under lateral transport, light, chemical, and pressure stimuli. We also note that the need for ionic screening renders polarization switching a coupled physical\textendash electrochemical process and discuss the non-trivial phenomena such as chaotic behavior during domain switching that stem from this.},

The conducting PEDOT layers as source, drain, and gate electrodes were patterned by using photolithography. The poly(vinyl cinnamate) (PVCN) was spin coated and cross-linked as a gate insulator. The pentacene as an active layer was vapor deposited onto the PVCN layer. In order to compare the characteristics of the pentacene-based organic thin film transistor (OTFT) with PEDOT electrodes, we fabricated another pentacene-based OTFT using a Si-based pattern with Au electrodes. The electrical characteristics of the devices, such as charge carrier mobility  ({$\mu$}) ({$\mu$}) , threshold voltage  ( V th ) (Vth) , and on/off current ratio  ( I on/off ) (Ion/off) , were measured from its current-voltage  (I-V) (I-V)  characteristic curves. The  {$\mu$} {$\mu$} ,  V th Vth , and  I on/off Ion/off  of the pentacene-based OTFT with PEDOT electrodes were  {$\sim$}2.3\texttimes{} 10 -3 cm 2 /Vs {$\sim$}2.3\texttimes 10-3cm2/Vs ,  4V 4V , and  {$\sim$}100 {$\sim$}100 , respectively. We evaluated the activation energy  ( E a ) (Ea)  of the pentacene layer of the OTFT devices by analyzing the transfer characteristic curves measured in a temperature range from  10to300K 10to300K  based on the multitrap and release model. The  E a Ea  of the OTFT with PEDOT electrodes was measured to be  {$\sim$}0.33eV {$\sim$}0.33eV , in the saturation region. This energy was larger than that of the OTFT with Au electrodes which was measured to be  {$\sim$}0.13eV {$\sim$}0.13eV . However, the  {$\mu$} {$\mu$} 's of both OTFTs were almost the same, in spite of the relatively lower electrical conductivity of the PEDOT and the larger  E a Ea  of the OTFT with the PEDOT electrodes. From the results of temperature dependence of current density based on the Schottky emission model, we analyze that the lower barrier height between the PEDOT electrode and the pentacene active layer resulted in easier charge injection from the PEDOT electrode into the active layer.}

The carrier mobility of the ISBN films exceeded at low temperature, much higher than that of pristine InSe films. It has been puzzling why the relatively inert hBN capping layer could so drastically enhance mobility of the ISBN composite. Using a state-of-the-art first principles method, we have calculated phonon limited carrier mobility of 18 different ISBN films and 6 pristine InSe films with different thicknesses, the largest system containing 2212 atoms. The hBN capping layer significantly alters the elastic stiffness coefficient as compared with pure InSe\textemdash thus the acoustic phonons in the ISBN composite\textemdash giving rise to the observed large mobility of ISBN films. Of the 18 calculated ISBN films, the ones with no strain at the hBN/InSe interface possess the highest electron mobility, reaching at room temperature, which could easily go over at low temperatures. We conclude that the mechanical properties of the composite 2D vdW ISBN material play the crucial role for inducing the large carrier mobility, a principle that could be applied to many other 2D vdW heterostructures.},

The onset of superconductivity in In2Se3 occurs at 41.3 GPa with a critical temperature (Tc) of 3.7 K, peaking at 47.1 GPa. The striking observation shows that this layered chalcogenide remains superconducting in decompression down to 10.7 GPa. More surprisingly, the highest Tc that occurs at lower decompression pressures is 8.2 K, a twofold increase in the same crystal structure as in compression. It is found that the evolution of Tc is driven by the pressure-induced R-3m to I-43d structural transition and significant softening of phonons and gentle variation of carrier concentration combined in the pressure quench. The novel decompression-induced superconductivity enhancement implies that it is possible to maintain pressure-induced superconductivity at lower or even ambient pressures with better superconducting performance.},

A ferroelectric field-effect transistor combines a ferroelectric material with a semiconductor in a transistor structure. In doing so, it merges logic and memory functionalities at the single-device level, delivering some of the most pressing hardware-level demands for emerging computing paradigms. Here, we examine the potential of the ferroelectric field-effect transistor technologies in current embedded non-volatile memory applications and future in-memory, biomimetic and alternative computing models.

It was observed that the BSFs result in a specific PL peak at \textasciitilde 3.329eV along with a donor bound excitonic emission (DoX) peak at 5K. The observed BSF-related emission is of excitonic type and possesses longer PL lifetime than DoX (\textasciitilde 360ps vs. \textasciitilde 70ps). Via comparison of the microstructural and the PL properties of the ZnO NWs, it is shown that the observed BSF-related emission is due to the formation of crystal phase quantum wells (QWs). This is explained by the fact that BSF in wurtzite (WZ) ZnO is the thinnest segment of zinc blende (ZB) phase ZnO inserted in the WZ matrix, resulting in band alignment of type II due to the conduction and valence band offsets of ZB with respect to WZ ZnO. The mechanism of the BSF related PL is suggested to be an indirect exciton transitions due to the recombination of electrons confined in the ZB QWs to holes in the WZ barriers localized near the BSFs.},

It is shown here that the transistors exhibit hysteresis in their electrical characteristics because of charge trapping by water molecules around the nanotubes, including SiO2 surface-bound water proximal to the nanotubes. Hysteresis persists for the transistors in vacuum since the SiO2-bound water does not completely desorb in vacuum at room temperature, a known phenomenon in SiO2 surface chemistry. Heating under dry conditions significantly removes water and reduces hysteresis in the transistors. Nearly hysteresis-free transistors are obtainable by passivating the devices with polymers that hydrogen bond with silanol groups on SiO2 (e.g., with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)). However, nanotube humidity sensors could be explored with suitable water-sensitive coatings. The results may have implications to field-effect transistors made from other chemically derived materials.}

Single-layer graphene substitutionally doped with boron was prepared by the mechanical exfoliation of boron-doped graphite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the amount of substitutional boron in graphite was {$\sim$}0.22 atom \%. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the boron atoms were spaced 4.76 nm apart in single-layer graphene. The 7-fold higher intensity of the D-band when compared to the G-band was explained by the elastically scattered photoexcited electrons by boron atoms before emitting a phonon. The frequency of the G-band in single-layer substitutionally boron-doped graphene was unchanged, which could be explained by the p-type boron doping (stiffening) counteracting the tensile strain effect of the larger carbon\textendash boron bond length (softening). Boron-doped graphene appears to be a useful tool for engineering the physical and chemical properties of graphene.}

In order to clarify the mechanism of the asymmetrical hysteresis phenomena observed in the transfer characteristics of the MoS2 and WSe2 FET, the temperature dependencies of their characteristics are analyzed. Based on these analyses, it can be concluded that donor-like traps present in both the SiO2/MoS2 interface and the MoS2 bulk in multi-layered MoS2 FETs, and that acceptor-like traps present in both the SiO2/WSe2 interface, and the WSe2 bulk in multi-layered WSe2 FETs.

  abstract = {We present the concept of ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). These junctions consist of two metal electrodes separated by a nanometer-thick ferroelectric barrier. The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed under the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant conduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect inherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The calculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the current-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier thickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge. Remarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to the piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place after the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze the influence of an internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening of polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for asymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable change of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the symmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that characteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from one to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of FTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and depolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar top and bottom electrodes are preferable for the nonvolatile memory applications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.},

For improved performance in organic photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, and field-effect transistors (FETs), efficient transport of the charge carriers within the organic semiconductor is especially critical. Characterization of charge transport in these organic semiconductors is important both from scientific and technological perspectives. In this review, we shall mainly discuss the techniques for measuring the charge carrier mobility and not the theoretical underpinnings of the mechanism of charge transport. Mobility measurements in organic semiconductors and particularly in conjugated polymers, using space-charge-limited current, time of flight, carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage, double injection, FETs, and impedance spectroscopy are discussed. The relative merits, as well as limitations for each of these techniques are reviewed. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys, 2012},

Here, we demonstrate that tin monosulfide (SnS) films less than 6 nm thick show optimum performance as a semiconductor channel in an in-plane ferroelectric analogue synaptic device, whereas thicker films have a much poorer ferroelectric response due to screening effects by a higher concentration of charge carriers. The SnS ferroelectric device exhibits synaptic behaviors with highly stable room-temperature operation, high linearity in potentiation/depression, long retention, and low cycle-to-cycle/device-to-device variations. The simulated device based on ferroelectric SnS achieves {$\sim$}92.1\% pattern recognition accuracy in an artificial neural network simulation. By switching the ferroelectric domains partially, multilevel conductance states and the conductance ratio can be obtained, achieving high pattern recognition accuracy.},

  abstract = {Basal-plane stacking faults are an important class of optically active structural defects in wurtzite semiconductors. The local deviation from the 2H stacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound state in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of excitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking faults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons with characteristic energies. Luminescence spectroscopy is thus capable of detecting even a single stacking fault in an otherwise perfect wurtzite crystal. This review draws a comprehensive picture of the luminescence properties related to stacking faults in GaN. The emission energies associated with different types of stacking faults as well as factors that can shift these energies are discussed. In this context, the importance of the quantum-confined Stark effect in these zinc-blende/wurtzite heterostructures, which results from the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite GaN, is underlined. This discussion is extended to zinc-blende segments in a wurtzite matrix. Furthermore, other factors affecting the emission energy and linewidth of stacking fault-related peaks as well as results obtained at room temperature are addressed. The considerations presented in this article should also be transferable to other wurtzite semiconductors.},

Here, we investigated thoroughly the gate bias stress and hysteresis effects in InAs nanowire FETs. It is observed that the output current decreases together with the threshold voltage shifting to the positive direction when a positive gate bias stress is applied, and vice versa for the negative gate bias stress. For double-sweep transfer characteristics, the significant hysteresis behavior is observed, depending heavily on the sweeping rate and range. On the basis of complementary investigations of these devices, charge traps are confirmed to be the dominant factor for these instability effects. Importantly, the hysteresis can be simulated well by utilizing a combination of the rate equation for electron density and the empirical model for electron mobility. This provides an accurate evaluation of carrier mobility, which is in distinct contrast to the overestimation of mobility when using the transconductance for calculation. All these findings are important for understanding the charge trap dynamics to further enhance the device performance of nanowire FETs.}

This temperature dependence as well as the value of the mobility clearly indicates that transport is bandlike.

Our results of electrical measurements support that, near the Pt/BiFeO3 interface of as-grown samples, a defective layer (possibly an oxygen-vacancy-rich layer) becomes formed and disturbs carrier injection. We therefore used an electrical training process to obtain ferroelectric control of the diode polarity where, by changing the polarization direction using an external bias, we could switch the transport characteristics between forward and reverse diodes. Our system is characterized with a rectangular polarization-hysteresis loop with which we confirmed that the diode-polarity switching occurred at the ferroelectric coercive voltage. Moreover, we observed a simultaneous switching of the diode polarity and the associated photovoltaic response dependent on the ferroelectric domain configurations. Our detailed study suggests that the polarization charge can affect the Schottky barrier at the ferroelectric/metal interfaces, resulting in a modulation of the interfacial carrier injection. The amount of polarization-modulated carrier injection can affect the transition voltage value at which a space-charge-limited bulk current\textendash voltage (J\textendash V) behavior is changed from Ohmic (i.e., J {$\propto$} V) to nonlinear (i.e., J {$\propto$} Vn with n {$\geq$} 2).

Correlation between resonance Raman spectroscopy and photoconductivity measurements allows us to systematically track the evolution of the electronic band structure of 2D InSe as its thickness approaches few atomic layers. Analysis of photoconductivity spectra suggests that few-layered InSe has an indirect band gap of 1.4 eV, which is 200 meV higher than bulk InSe due to the suppressed interlayer electron orbital coupling. Temperature-dependent photocurrent measurements reveal that the suppressed interlayer interaction also results in more localized pz-like orbitals, and these orbitals couple strongly with the in-plane E{${'}$} and E{${''}$} phonons. Finally, we measured a strong photoresponse of 34.7 mA/W and fast response time of 488 {$\mu$}s for a few layered InSe, suggesting that it is a good material for thin film optoelectronic applications.},

A strong photoresponse was observed in both unipolar MoS2 and ambipolar WSe2 FETs (i) at the high drain voltage due to a high electric field along the channel for separating photo-excited charge carriers and (ii) at the certain gate voltage due to the optimized barriers for the collection of photo-excited charge carriers at metal contacts. The effective barrier height between Ti/Au and TMDCs was estimated by a low temperature measurement. An ohmic contact behavior and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) were clearly observed in MoS2 FET. In contrast, a Schottky-to-ohmic contact transition was observed in WSe2 FET as the gate voltage increases, due to the change of majority carrier transport from holes to electrons. The gate-dependent barrier modulation effectively controls the carrier transport, demonstrating its great potential in 2D TMDCs for electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

Herein, we report the first-principles evidence of 2D vertical ferroelectricity induced by interlayer translation, which exists extensively in the graphitic bilayer of BN, AlN, ZnO, MoS2, GaSe, etc.; the bilayer of some 2D ferromagnets like MXene, VS2, and MoN2 can be even multiferroics with switchable magnetizations upon ferroelectric switching, rendering efficient reading and writing for high-density data storage. In particular, the electromechanical coupling between interlayer translation and potential can be used to drive the flow of electrons as nanogenerators for harvesting energy from human activities, ocean waves, mechanical vibration, etc. A ferroelectric superlattice with spatial varying potential can be formed in a bilayer Moire pattern upon a small twist or strain, making it possible to generate periodic n/p doped-domains and shape the periodicity of the potential energy landscape. Finally, some of their multilayer counterparts with wurtzite structures like a ZnO multilayer are revealed to exhibit another type of vertical ferroelectricity with greatly enhanced polarizations.},

A robust layered indium selenide (InSe) field-effect transistor (FET) with superior controlled stability is demonstrated by depositing an indium (In) doping layer. The optimized InSe FETs deliver an unprecedented high electron mobility up to 3700 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room temperature, which can be retained with 60\% after 1 month. Further insight into the evolution of the position of the Fermi level and the microscopic device structure with different In thicknesses demonstrates an enhanced electron-doping behavior at the In/InSe interface. Furthermore, the contact resistance is also improved through the In insertion between InSe and Au electrodes, which coincides with the analysis of the low-frequency noise. The carrier fluctuation is attributed to the dominance of the phonon scattering events, which agrees with the observation of the temperature-dependent mobility. Finally, the flexible functionalities of the logic-circuit applications, for instance, inverter and not-and (NAND)/not-or (NOR) gates, are determined with these surface-doping InSe FETs, which establish a paradigm for 2D-based materials to overcome the bottleneck in the development of electronic devices.},

In these applications, the carrier mobility, that is the ability of electrons and holes to move rapidly in response to an external voltage, is a critical design parameter. Here, we show that the interlayer coupling between electronic wave functions in 2D semiconductors can be used to drastically alter carrier mobility and dynamics. We demonstrate this concept by performing state-of-the-art ab initio calculations for InSe, a prototypical 2D semiconductor that is attracting considerable attention, because of its exceptionally high electron mobility. We show that the electron mobility of InSe can be increased from 100 cm2 V\textendash 1 s\textendash 1 to 1000 cm2 V\textendash 1 s\textendash 1 by exploiting the dimensional crossover of the electronic density of states from two dimensions to three dimensions.

However, the reported 2D materials-based nonvolatile memory devices have complicated architectures with multilayer stacking of 2D materials, metals, organics or oxides, which limits their capacity for device miniaturization, scalability and integration functionality. In this work, we propose a nonvolatile charge memory in pristine {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 nanosheets with a two-terminal configuration. We present a programmable nonvolatile charge memory via applying gate voltage pulses. The devices show superb memory properties at room temperature with a large memory window, long retention time and robust endurance, which are comparable with 2D material heterostructures. Further, we demonstrate an optical manipulation of charge storage with laser power-controlled numbers of stored charges and on/off ratio. Supported by a theoretical model, we find the nonvolatile charge storage originates from the surficial/interfacial trapped electrons, which are removed via photo-generated holes. Our photo-tunable nonvolatile charge memory devices with simple structure pave the way towards large-scale integration and high-speed intelligent electronics, such as ultrafast remote operation on data coding, artificial synapse and neurons.},

In particular, in contrast to many high-mobility two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as phosphorene, InSe is more resilient to oxidation in air. Nevertheless, its implementation in future applications requires encapsulation techniques to prevent the adsorption of gas molecules on its surface. In this work, we use a common lithography resist, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to encapsulate InSe-based field-effect transistors (FETs). The encapsulation of InSe by PMMA improves the electrical stability of the FETs under a gate bias stress, and increases both the drain current and electron mobility.

The unique band structures of strong in-plane chemical bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions make 2D materials promising for nanodevices and various other applications. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and non-destructive characterization tool to study the properties of 2D materials. In this work, we review the research on the characterization of 2D materials with Raman spectroscopy. In addition, we discuss the application of the Raman spectroscopy technique to semiconductors, superconductivity, photoelectricity, and thermoelectricity.},

  abstract = {2D intercorrelated ferroelectrics, exhibiting a coupled in-plane and out-of-plane ferroelectricity, is a fundamental phenomenon in the field of condensed-mater physics. The current research is based on the paradigm of bi-directional inversion asymmetry in single-layers, which restricts 2D intercorrelated ferroelectrics to extremely few systems. Herein, we propose a new scheme for achieving 2D intercorrelated ferroelectrics using van der Waals (vdW) interaction, and apply this scheme to a vast family of 2D vdW materials. Using first-principles, we demonstrate that 2D vdW multilayers, for example, BN, MoS2, InSe, CdS, PtSe2, TI2O, SnS2, Ti2CO2etc., can exhibit coupled in-plane and out-of-plane ferroelectricity, thus yielding 2D intercorrelated ferroelectric physics. We further predict that such intercorrelated ferroelectrics could demonstrate many distinct properties, for example, electrical full control of spin textures in trilayer PtSe2 and electrical permanent control of valley-contrasting physics in four-layer VS2. Our finding opens a new direction for 2D intercorrelated ferroelectric research.},

Here we report density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the Born-Szigeti theory of pyroelectricity, by combining fundamental thermodynamics and the modern theory of polarization. We find satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the case of bulk benchmark materials, showing that the so-called electron-phonon renormalization, whose contribution has been traditionally viewed as negligible, is important. We predict out-of-plane pyroelectricity in the recently synthesized Janus MoSSe monolayer and in-plane pyroelectricity in the group-IV monochalcogenide GeS monolayer. It is notable that the so-called secondary pyroelectricity is found to be dominant in GeS monolayer. The present work opens a theoretical route to study the pyroelectric effect using DFT and provides a valuable tool in the search for new candidates for pyroelectric applications.},

In contrast to 300 K, the cryogenic drain saturation current (Idsat) gain significantly enhances from 54\% to 167\% with the increasing channel length and has a relatively weak response to width change. In addition, the degraded subthreshold swing (SS) due to the short channel effect is alleviated at lower temperatures. The merits of a typical nMOS transistor (W/L = 0.6 {$\mu$}m/60 nm) worked at 4.2 K are associated with an improved Idsat ( 1.3 times), decreased drain leakage current with three orders of magnitude, and 2/3 reduced SS. However, the cryogenic Idsat tends to saturate below 10 K and the threshold voltage increases, as well as barrier lowering induced by drain voltage, starts to deteriorate. The detailed analyses on these MOSFET (deep) cryogenic characteristics are implemented based on the comprehensive semiconductor physics images, including energy band change, temperature/geometry-dependent scattering, band-to-band tunneling process, and depletion width influence. Our findings will be beneficial for the community to design ultralow temperature-integrated circuits.},

Combining lattice symmetry and local atomic perturbation, we demonstrate a novel layered {$\alpha{'}$}-In2Se3 phase by using the first-principles calculations, which is reconstructed from the inverted tetrahedral bonding configuration by the in-plane displacive middle layer Se atom. The optimized structure of monolayer {$\alpha{'}$}-In2Se3 has triple degenerated atomic configurations with different Se atom orientations. We noted that these degenerated atomic configurations exhibit a moderate switching barrier (about 61\,meV/f.u.) between them. To further explore this atom-oriented anisotropic property in {$\alpha{'}$}-In2Se3, the electronic properties were studied with an orthorhombic unit cell. The comparative results for the orthogonal Se atom orientations suggest that the nonbonding orbital coupling of the displacive Se atoms induces large in-plane anisotropic optical absorption and electrical transport properties. This study of the layered {$\alpha{'}$}-In2Se3 phase can extend the realm of switchable anisotropic optoelectronic applications in future electronic devices.},

When a voltage is applied to this ferroelectric capacitor, a clear transition from an insulator to a metal and vice versa is observed in the transistor. Importantly, when the biased voltage is turned off, the remnant polarization in the ferroelectric can keep the MoS2 in its original phase, thereby providing a non-volatile state.

Beim Abk\"uhlen der Hochtemperaturformen erh\"alt man gew\"ohnlich nicht {$\gamma$}-In2Se3, sondern Varianten des {$\beta$}-In2Se3, n\"amlich {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(H) ({$\alpha$}(2)-In2Se3) (hP10) und {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(R) ({$\alpha$}(3)-In2Se3) (hR5), die beim Aufheizen \"uber die ebenfalls metastabilen Formen {$\beta$}'-In2Se3 (hP15) und {$\beta$}-In2Se3(R) (hR5) in das stabile {$\gamma$}-In2Se3 \"ubergehen. Bei Raumtemperatur stabil bzw. metastabil sind nur {$\gamma$}-In2Se3, {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(H) und {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(R). Die Infrarotspektren und r\"ontgenographischen Dichten der verschiedenen polymorphen Formen des In2Se3 sowie die Art der Phasenumwandlungen werden diskutiert. The phase relationships of polymorphic In2Se3 were reinvestigated by high-temperature X-ray powder studies. The modification, which is (contrary to most references) stable at room temperature, is {$\gamma$}-In2Se3 (hP30) with four-fold and fivefold coordinated indium ions. Above 960 K {$\gamma$}-In2Se3 undergoes a phase transition to the more dense (CN = 6?) {$\beta$}-In2Se3(H) (hP10), which changes to {$\delta$}-In2Se3 (hP5) above 1080 K. On cooling the high-temperature polymorphs to ambient temperature the stable {$\gamma$}-In2Se3 is not normally obtained, but metastable variants of {$\beta$}-In2Se3, viz. {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(H) ({$\alpha$}(2)-In2Se3) (hP10) or {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(R) ({$\alpha$}(3)-In2Se3) (hR5), which transform on heating via the similarly metastable {$\beta$}'-In2Se3 (hP15) and {$\beta$}-In2Se3(R) (hR5), respectively, into {$\gamma$}-In2Se3. The only stable or metastable polymorphs which exist at ambient temperature are {$\gamma$}-In2Se3, {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(H) and {$\alpha$}-In2Se3(R). The IR spectra and X-ray densities of the various polymorphs of In2Se3 as well as the phase transitions are discussed in terms of the possible structures.},

  abstract = {Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2 and WS2, have recently triggered worldwide research interest due to their remarkable optical and electronic properties. More fascinatingly is the fact that these monolayers could also adopt various morphologies with exposed edges that include triangular, hexagonal or star-shaped clusters, in addition to nanoribbons. Exciting progress has been recently achieved in the synthesis, characterization, device fabrication and functionalization of these monolayer and few-layer TMDs. This article firstly reviews the properties of bulk and monolayer/few-layer TMDs. The ``top-down'' and ``bottom-up'' synthesis routes for different TMDs are then summarized. Raman spectroscopy is now becoming a key tool used to characterize atomically thin TMDs, and this review will show the latest advances using this spectroscopic technique. Here we also summarize the most relevant characterization techniques, optical/electronic device fabrication, functionalization and defect engineering of TMDs. There are numerous opportunities for applications and multiple challenges to overcome, and this review will be instructive and useful to researchers working in the area of 2-dimensional materials, as well as scientists and engineers interested in their applications in electronics, optics, catalysis, energy and many others.},

  abstract = {{$\alpha$}-In2Se3 has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its excellent electrical and optical properties. Especially, attention has been paid to its peculiar ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties which most other two-dimensional (2D) materials do not possess. This paper presents the first measurement of the thickness-dependent band gaps of few-layer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The band gap increases with decreasing film thickness which varies from 1.44 eV in a 48 nm thick area to 1.64 eV in an 8 nm thick area of the samples. Further, by combining the improved exchange-correlation potential and proper screening of the internal electric field in an advanced 2D electronic structure technique, we have been able to obtain the structural dependence of the band gap within density functional theory up to hundreds of atoms. This is also the first calculation of a similar type for 2D ferroelectric materials. Both experiment and theory suggest that the variation of the band gap of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 fits well with the quantum confinement model for 2D materials.},

This work will examine two major causes of the short retention (assuming no significant mobile ionic charge motion in the ferroelectric film): 1) depolarization field and 2) finite gate leakage current. A possible solution to the memory retention problem will be suggested, which involves the growth of single-crystal, single domain ferroelectric on Si. The use of the ferroelectric memory transistor as a capacitor-less DRAM cell will also be proposed.},

To fully explore their exotic physical properties and facilitate potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics, an effective and versatile characterization method is highly demanded. Among the many methods of characterization, optical second harmonic generation (SHG) has attracted broad attention because of its sensitivity, versatility and simplicity. The SHG technique is sufficiently sensitive at the atomic scale and therefore suitable for studies on 2D materials. More importantly, it has the capacity to acquire abundant information ranging from crystallographic, and electronic, to magnetic properties in various 2D materials due to its sensitivity to both spatial-inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. These advantages accompanied by its characteristics of non-invasion and high throughput make SHG a powerful tool for 2D materials. This review summarizes recent experimental developments of SHG applications in 2D materials and also provides an outlook of potential prospects based on SHG.},

Estimates for the spontaneous polarization are calculated at various temperatures from the atomic coordinates and found to agree well with dielectric measurements.

We demonstrate that the introduction of hydrogen to the argon carrier gas dramatically improves the optical quality and increases the growth area of WS2, resulting in films exhibiting mm2 coverage. The addition of hydrogen more effectively reduces the WO3 precursor and protects against oxidative etching of the synthesized monolayers. The stoichiometric WS2 monolayers synthesized using Ar\,+\,H2 carrier gas exhibit superior optical characteristics, with photoluminescence emission full width half maximum (FWHM) values below 40\,meV and emission intensities nearly an order of magnitude higher than films synthesized in a pure Ar environment.},

Here, based upon that model, a two-species-percolation scaling theory is introduced and compared to the experimental data. It is shown that many features of the experiments, such as the exponential dependence of the resistance on temperature on the metallic side, the linear dependence of the exponent on density, the e2/h scale of the critical resistance, the quenching of the metallic phase by a parallel magnetic field and the non-monotonic dependence of the critical density on a perpendicular magnetic field, can be naturally explained by the model. Moreover, details such as the non-monotonic dependence of the resistance on temperature or the inflection point of the resistance vs. parallel magnetic field are also a natural consequence of the theory. The calculated parallel field dependence of the critical density agrees excellently with experiments, and is used to deduce an experimental value of the confining energy in the vertical direction.},

  abstract = {Polymers have exceptional charge transport mechanism as a combination of delocalization and localization of charge carriers with intramolecular and intermolecular charge interaction, respectively, and most of the time, it is interpreted with Mott-Gurney space charge\textendash limited current model. As polymers are full of traps, therefore, Mott-Gurney space charge\textendash limited model is modified with various trap distributions as trapped space charge\textendash limited model. The most crucial parameter affected by the nature and distribution of traps is the carrier mobility, and it is argued that space charge\textendash limited model is an acceptable choice for the mobility measurement for polymer. Similarly, in order to account the commonly observed lowering of trap barrier height at higher electric field, the Mott-Gurney space charge\textendash limited current is further modified with little variations, which are evaluated and discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {Conductivity of the insulating phase increases generally at an elevated drain\textendash source voltage due to the field-enhanced hopping or heating effect. Meanwhile, a transport mechanism governed by percolation in a low compensated semiconductor gives rise to the reduced conductivity at a low-field regime. Here, in addition to this behavior, we report the anomalous conductivity behavior to transform from a percolative metallic to an insulating phase at the low voltage regime in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Percolation transport at low source\textendash drain voltage is governed by inhomogeneously distributed potential in strongly interacting monolayer MoS2 with a substrate, distinct from the quantum phase transition in multilayer MoS2. At a high source\textendash drain voltage regime, the insulating phase is transformed further to a metallic phase, exhibiting multiphases of metallic\textendash insulating\textendash metallic transitions in monolayer MoS2. These behaviors highlight MoS2 as a model system to study various classical and quantum transports as well as metal\textendash insulator transition in two-dimensional systems.}

Here, we examine the finite-temperature transport behavior of few-layered MoS2 material in the vicinity of the density-driven metal-insulator transition, revealing previously overlooked universal features characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems. Our scaling analysis, based on the Wigner-Mott theoretical viewpoint, conclusively demonstrates that the transition is driven by strong electron-electron interactions and not disorder, in striking resemblance to what is seen in other Mott systems. Our results provide compelling evidence that transition-metal dichalcogenides provide an ideal testing ground, and should open an exciting avenue for the study of strong correlation physics.}

We investigate this direct-to-indirect bandgap crossover, demonstrate a highly tuneable optical response from the near infrared to the visible spectrum with decreasing layer thickness down to 2 layers, and report quantum dot-like optical emissions distributed over a wide range of energy. Our analysis also indicates that electron and exciton effective masses are weakly dependent on the layer thickness and are significantly smaller than in other vdW crystals. These properties are unprecedented within the large family of vdW crystals and demonstrate the potential of InSe for electronic and photonic technologies.},

Temperature dependence of conductivity are analyzed by three mechanisms: extended state conductivity, conduction in band tail and conduction in localized sites. It is clear from the results that at high temperatures conductivity mechanism obeys the law ln{$\sigma\propto$}1/T and at low temperatures: ln{$\sigma\propto$}T-1/4, indicating variable range hopping energy in the localized states near the Fermi level N (EF). The incorporation of In atoms in Se matrix leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity and decrease in the thermal activation energy. The change in the above parameters will be discussed in terms of the phase transition, which takes place in InxSe1-x thin films.},

  abstract = {Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a powerful characterization technique to readily image and manipulate the ferroelectric domains. PFM gives an insight into the strength of local piezoelectric coupling and polarization direction through PFM amplitude and phase, respectively. Converting measured arbitrary units into units of effective piezoelectric constant remains a challenge, and insufficient methods are often used. While most quantification efforts have been spent on quantifying the PFM amplitude signal, little attention has been given to the PFM phase, which is often arbitrarily adjusted to fit expectations. This is problematic when investigating materials with unknown or negative sign of the probed effective electrostrictive coefficient or strong frequency dispersion of electromechanical responses, because assumptions about the PFM phase cannot be reliably made. The PFM phase can, however, provide important information on the polarization orientation and the sign of the effective electrostrictive coefficient probed by PFM. Most notably, the orientation of the PFM hysteresis loop is determined by the PFM phase. Moreover, when presenting PFM data as a combined signal, the resulting response can be artificially lowered or asymmetric if the phase data have not been correctly processed. Here, we explain the PFM amplitude quantification process and demonstrate a path to identify the phase offset required to extract correct meaning from the PFM phase data. We explore different sources of phase offsets including the experimental setup, instrumental contributions, and data analysis. We discuss the physical working principles of PFM and develop a strategy to extract physical meaning from the PFM amplitude and phase.},

However, a general understanding of the origin of these omnipresent charge traps, as well as their energetic position, distribution and concentration, is lacking. Here we investigate electron transport in a wide range of semiconducting polymers by current\textendash voltage measurements of single-carrier devices. We observe for this materials class that electron transport is limited by traps that exhibit a Gaussian energy distribution in the bandgap. Remarkably, the electron-trap distribution is identical for all polymers considered: the number of traps amounts to 3 \texttimes{} 1023\,traps\,per~m3 centred at an energy of \textasciitilde 3.6\,eV below the vacuum level, with a typical distribution width of \textasciitilde 0.1\,eV. This indicates that the electron traps have a common origin that, we suggest, is most likely related to hydrated oxygen complexes. A consequence of this finding is that the trap-limited electron current can be predicted for any polymer.},

However, we do have some successful examples to draw upon: Composite materials and III-V heterostructures have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. Still, we need a general strategy to solve the problem of mixing and matching crystals with different properties, creating combinations with predetermined attributes and functionalities. ADVANCESTwo-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform that allows creation of heterostructures with a variety of properties. One-atom-thick crystals now comprise a large family of these materials, collectively covering a very broad range of properties. The first material to be included was graphene, a zero-overlap semimetal. The family of 2D crystals has grown to includes metals (e.g., NbSe2), semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), and insulators [e.g., hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)]. Many of these materials are stable at ambient conditions, and we have come up with strategies for handling those that are not. Surprisingly, the properties of such 2D materials are often very different from those of their 3D counterparts. Furthermore, even the study of familiar phenomena (like superconductivity or ferromagnetism) in the 2D case, where there is no long-range order, raises many thought-provoking questions.A plethora of opportunities appear when we start to combine several 2D crystals in one vertical stack. Held together by van der Waals forces (the same forces that hold layered materials together), such heterostructures allow a far greater number of combinations than any traditional growth method. As the family of 2D crystals is expanding day by day, so too is the complexity of the heterostructures that could be created with atomic precision.When stacking different crystals together, the synergetic effects become very important. In the first-order approximation, charge redistribution might occur between the neighboring (and even more distant) crystals in the stack. Neighboring crystals can also induce structural changes in each other. Furthermore, such changes can be controlled by adjusting the relative orientation between the individual elements.Such heterostructures have already led to the observation of numerous exciting physical phenomena. Thus, spectrum reconstruction in graphene interacting with hBN allowed several groups to study the Hofstadter butterfly effect and topological currents in such a system. The possibility of positioning crystals in very close (but controlled) proximity to one another allows for the study of tunneling and drag effects. The use of semiconducting monolayers leads to the creation of optically active heterostructures.The extended range of functionalities of such heterostructures yields a range of possible applications. Now the highest-mobility graphene transistors are achieved by encapsulating graphene with hBN. Photovoltaic and light-emitting devices have been demonstrated by combining optically active semiconducting layers and graphene as transparent electrodes. OUTLOOKCurrently, most 2D heterostructures are composed by direct stacking of individual monolayer flakes of different materials. Although this method allows ultimate flexibility, it is slow and cumbersome. Thus, techniques involving transfer of large-area crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), direct growth of heterostructures by CVD or physical epitaxy, or one-step growth in solution are being developed. Currently, we are at the same level as we were with graphene 10 years ago: plenty of interesting science and unclear prospects for mass production. Given the fast progress of graphene technology over the past few years, we can expect similar advances in the production of the heterostructures, making the science and applications more achievable. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6298/aac9439/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Production of van der Waals heterostructures.Owing to a large number of 2D crystals available today, many functional van der Waals heterostructures can be created. What started with mechanically assembled stacks (top) has now evolved to large-scale growth by CVD or physical epitaxy (bottom). The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices\textemdash such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes\textemdash are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.},

The resonant conditions of Raman scattering are observed at about 270~K under the 1.96~eV excitation for GaSe due to the energy proximity of the optical band gap. In the case of InSe, the resonant Raman spectra are apparent at about 50 and 270~K under correspondingly the 2.41~eV and 2.54~eV excitations as a result of the energy proximity of the so-called B transition. Interestingly, the observed resonances for both materials are followed by an antiresonance behaviour noticeable at higher temperatures than the detected resonances. The significant variations of phonon-modes intensities can be explained in terms of electron-phonon coupling and quantum interference of contributions from different points of the Brillouin zone.},

We use complementary characterization and modeling techniques to reveal significant electron trapping/de-trapping behavior, together with a strong temperature dependence of the electron emission kinetics in ferroelectric layers, which results from the onset of polarization of the ferroelectric layer. This can lead to an apparent difference in the defect characteristics in ferroelectric-HfO2 compared to the paraelectric-HfO2 structures they are shown to closely resemble when this contribution is decoupled. The results demonstrate the presence of a defect band closely aligned to the silicon conduction band, which can easily be accessed during device operation.}

Strong optical birefringence is observed using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The nonlinear optical susceptibility extracted from SHG polarimetry reveals that the tensor components are of the same magnitude as in the isostructural insulator LiNbO3, except the component along the polar axis d33 is suppressed by an order of magnitude. Temperature-dependent SHG measurements in combination with Raman spectroscopy indicate a continuous order-disorder type polar phase transition at 140\,K.

This transistor-type ferroelectric memory has interesting fundamental device physics and potentially large industrial impact. Among various applications of ferroelectric thin films, the development of nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) has been most actively progressed since the late 1980s and reached modest mass production for specific application since 1995. There are two types of memory cells in ferroelectric nonvolatile memories. One is the capacitor-type FeRAM and the other is the field-effect transistor (FET)-type FeRAM. Although the FET-type FeRAM claims the ultimate scalability and nondestructive readout characteristics, the capacitor-type FeRAMs have been the main interest for the major semiconductor memory companies, because the ferroelectric FET has fatal handicaps of cross-talk for random accessibility and short retention time. This book aims to provide the readers with development history, technical issues, fabrication methodologies, and promising applications of FET-type ferroelectric memory devices, presenting a comprehensive review of past, present, and future technologies. The topics discussed will lead to further advances in large-area electronics implemented on glass, plastic or paper substrates as well as in conventional Si electronics.

As acceptor-like traps at the interface are frozen below 230 K, the hysteresis becomes negligible but simultaneously the channel mobility significantly degrades because the inactive neutral traps allow additional collisions of electrons at the interface. This is confirmed by the fact that a gate bias adversely affects the channel mobility. An activation energy of such traps is estimated as 170 meV. The activated trap charges' trapping and de-trapping processes in response to the gate pulse bias reveal that the time constants for the slow and fast processes decrease due to additionally activated traps as the temperature increases.},

Here, we report on our observation on the occurrence of MIT in the 2D material system of copper indium selenide (CuIn7Se11). Clear evidence of the metallic nature of conductivity ({$\sigma$}) under the influence of electrostatic doping via the gate, which crosses over to an insulating phase upon lowering the temperature, was observed by investigating the temperature and gate dependence of {$\sigma$} in CuIn7Se11 field-effect transistor devices. At higher charge carrier densities (n {$>$} 1012 cm\textendash 1), we found that {$\sigma$} {$\sim$} (n){$\alpha$} with {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 2, which suggests the presence of bare Coulomb impurity scattering within the studied range of temperature (280 K {$>$} T {$>$} 20 K). Our analysis of the conductivity data following the principles of percolation theory of transition where {$\sigma$} {$\sim$} (n - nC){$\delta$} show that the critical percolation exponent {$\delta$}(T) has average values {$\sim$}1.57 {$\pm$} 0.27 and 1.02 {$\pm$} 0.35 within the measured temperature range for the two devices and it is close to the 2D percolation exponent value of 1.33. We believe that the 2D MIT seen in our system is due to the charge density inhomogeneity caused by electrostatic doping and unscreened charge impurity scattering that leads to a percolation driven transition. The findings reported here for CuIn7Se11 system provide a different material platform to investigate MIT in 2D and are crucial in order to understand the fundamental basis of electronic interactions and charge-transport phenomenon in other unexplored 2D electron systems.}

It was found that the voltage behavior of the leakage current has a minor dependence on thickness, which rules out the space-charge limited currents as main leakage source. Temperature-dependent measurements were performed to obtain more information on the transport mechanism through the metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structure. The results are analyzed in the frame of interface-controlled Schottky emission. A surprisingly low value of only 0.12\textendash 0.13eV was obtained for the potential barrier, which is much smaller than the reported value of 0.87eV [I. Stolichnov et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 1790 (1999)]. The result is explained by the effect of the ferroelectric polarization on the potential barrier height. The low value of the effective Richardson constant, of the order of 10-7\textendash 10-6A/cm2K2, suggests that the pure thermionic emission is not the adequate conduction mechanism for epitaxial MFM structures.

  abstract = {Ferroelectric thin film has attracted great interest for nonvolatile memory applications and can be used in either ferroelectric Schottky diodes or ferroelectric tunneling junctions due to its promise of fast switching speed, high on-to-off ratio, and nondestructive readout. Two-dimensional {$\alpha$}-phase indium selenide (In2Se3), which has a modest band gap and robust ferroelectric properties stabilized by dipole locking, is an excellent candidate for multidirectional piezoelectric and switchable photodiode applications. However, the large-scale synthesis of this material is still elusive, and its performance as a ferroresistive memory junction is rarely reported. Here, we report the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) of large-area monolayer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 on graphene and demonstrate the use of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 on graphene in ferroelectric Schottky diode junctions by employing high-work-function gold as the top electrode. The polarization-modulated Schottky barrier formed at the interface exhibits a giant electroresistance ratio of 3.9 \texttimes{} 106 with a readout current density of {$>$}12 A/cm2, which is more than 200\% higher than the state-of-the-art technology. Our MBE growth method allows a high-quality ultrathin film of In2Se3 to be heteroepitaxially grown on graphene, thereby simplifying the fabrication of high-performance 2D ferroelectric junctions for ferroresistive memory applications.},

Although some progress has been made in this regard, in many cases, oxygenation has been reported to lead to degradation of one or both properties. In this scenario, employing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that oxygen adsorption onto the surface of the noncentrosymmetric structure of two-dimensional (2D) In2Se3 results in the coexistence of innate electronic polarization and topologically protected edge states, rendering In2Se3O a stable topological insulator with conventional and topological band gaps greater than the thermal energy at room temperature. Furthermore, the feasibility of controlling the topological phase by field-effect switching is also demonstrated.}

Namely, the absorption, transmission, and reflection spectra that were recorded in the incident light wavelength range of 300?1100?nm, for the InSe, CdSe, and InSe/CdSe interface revealed direct allowed transition energy bandgaps of 1.44, 1.85, and 1.52?eV, respectively.

On the other hand, the dielectric constant spectral analysis displayed a large increase in the real part of the dielectric constant associated with decreasing frequency below 500?THz. In addition, the optical conductivity spectra that were analyzed and modeled in accordance with the Drude theory displayed a free-carrier average scattering time of 0.4?fs and a drift mobility of 6.65?cm2?V?1?s?1 for the InSe/CdSe interface.

  abstract = {Ferro- and piezo-electrets are non-polar polymer foams or film systems with internally charged cavities. Since their invention more than two decades ago, ferroelectrets have become a welcome addition to the range of piezo-, pyro-, and ferro-electric materials available for device applications. A polarization-versus-electric-field hysteresis is an essential feature of a ferroelectric material and may also be used for determining some of its main properties. Here, a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit and a combination of unipolar and bipolar voltage waveforms are employed to record hysteresis curves on cellular-foam polypropylene ferroelectret films and on tubular-channel fluoroethylenepropylene copolymer ferroelectret film systems. Internal dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are required for depositing the internal charges in ferroelectrets. The true amount of charge transferred during the internal DBDs is obtained from voltage measurements on a standard capacitor connected in series with the sample, but with a much larger capacitance than the sample. Another standard capacitor with a much smaller capacitance\textemdash which is, however, still considerably larger than the sample capacitance\textemdash is also connected in series as a high-voltage divider protecting the electrometer against destructive breakdown. It is shown how the DBDs inside the polymer cavities lead to phenomenological hysteresis curves that cannot be distinguished from the hysteresis loops found on other ferroic materials. The physical mechanisms behind the hysteresis behavior are described and discussed.}

  abstract = {Electron-electron scattering usually dominates the transport in strongly correlated materials. It typically leads to pronounced resistivity maxima in the incoherent regime around the coherence temperature T{${_\ast}$}, reflecting the tendency of carriers to undergo Mott localization following the demise of the Fermi liquid. This behavior is best pronounced in the vicinity of interaction-driven (Mott-like) metal-insulator transitions, where the T{${_\ast}$} decreases, while the resistivity maximum {$\rho$}max increases. Here we show that in this regime, the entire family of resistivity curves displays a characteristic scaling behavior {$\rho$}(T)/{$\rho$}max{$\approx$}F(T/Tmax), while the {$\rho$}max and Tmax{$\sim$}T{${_\ast}$} assume a power-law dependence on the quasiparticle effective mass m{${_\ast}$}. Remarkably, precisely such trends are found from an appropriate scaling analysis of experimental data obtained from diluted two-dimensional electron gases in zero magnetic fields. Our analysis provides strong evidence that inelastic electron-electron scattering\textemdash and not disorder effects\textemdash dominates finite-temperature transport in these systems, validating the Wigner-Mott picture of the two-dimensional metal-insulator transition.}

First, we analyze the semiconducting and ferroelectric properties of the {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 van der Waals (vdW) stack via experimental characterization and first-principles simulations. Then, we develop a FeSMJ device simulation framework by self-consistently solving the Landau\textendash Ginzburg\textendash Devonshire equation, Poisson's equation, and charge-transport equations. Based on the extracted Fe-semiconductor (FeS) parameters, our simulation results show good agreement with the experimental characteristics of our fabricated {$\alpha$}-In2Se3-based FeSMJ. Our analysis suggests that the FeS polarization-dependent modulation of Schottky barrier heights of FeSMJ plays a key role in providing the NVM functionality. Besides, the appearance of mobile carriers in FeS due to its semiconducting properties leads to a non-uniform electric field. This further induces partial polarization switching in the FeS layers, resulting in asymmetry in the FeSMJ characteristics for positive and negative voltages. Moreover, we show that the thickness scaling of FeS leads to a reduction in read/write voltage and an increase in distinguishability. Array-level analysis of FeSMJ NVM suggests a lower read-time and read-write energy with respect to the HfO2-based ferroelectric insulator tunnel junction.},

Yet the properties of some members of the chalcogenide family remain unexplored. Indium selenide (InSe) is attractive for applications due to its direct bandgap in the near infrared, controllable p- and n-type doping and high chemical stability. Here, we reveal the lattice dynamics, optical and electronic properties of atomically thin InSe flakes prepared by micromechanical cleavage. Raman active modes stiffen or soften in the flakes depending on which electronic bonds are excited. A progressive blue-shift of the photoluminescence peaks is observed for decreasing flake thickness (as large as 0.2 eV for three single layers). First-principles calculations predict an even larger increase in the bandgap, 0.40 eV, for three single layers, and as much as 1.1 eV for a single layer. These results are promising from the point of view of the versatility of this material for optoelectronic applications at the nanometer scale and compatible with Si and III-V technologies.},

These ferroelectric random-access memories are expected to replace magnetic core memory, magnetic bubble memory systems, and electrically erasable read-only memory for many applications. The switching kinetics of these films, 100 to 300 nanometers thick, are now well understood, with switching times that fit an activation field dependence that scales applied field and temperature. Earlier problems of fatigue and retention failure are also now understood and have been improved to acceptable levels.},

The uniformity of the contact resistance for gold, tungsten, and SrRuO3 electrodes on polycrystalline ternary Bi2Te3-based alloys for different types of surface cleaning procedures was characterized. The presence of a nanometer-thick native oxide layer on the Bi2Te3 surface leads to large and non-uniform contact resistance. Surface treatments included solvent cleans and chemical and dry etching prior to metallization of the Bi2Te3. Only etching the surface led to a significant improvement in contact resistance uniformity. None of the tested contacts reacted with the underlying Bi2Te3 substrate. Etching resulted in the removal of the native oxide on the Bi2Te3 surface, which was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The average thickness, chemistry, and dry etch rate of the native oxide was further characterized using XPS. The non-uniformity in contact resistance suggests that the native oxide grows non-uniformly on polycrystalline bismuth telluride surfaces.},

Here, we provide evidence that native metallicity and ferroelectricity coexist in bulk crystalline van der Waals WTe2 by means of electrical transport, nanoscale piezoresponse measurements, and first-principles calculations. We show that, despite being a Weyl semimetal, WTe2 has switchable spontaneous polarization and a natural ferroelectric domain structure at room temperature. This new class of materials has tantalizing potential for functional nanoelectronics applications. WTe2, a layered crystalline material, displays both ferroelectricity and metallicity.

Apart from nonvolatility, lower power usage, and a faster writing operation compared with traditional dynamic RAMs, our proposal has the advantage of a faster reading operation and a nondestructive reading process, thus overcoming the write-after-read problem that exists widely in current ferroelectric RAMs. The recent discovered room-temperature ferroelectric IV-VI semiconductor thin films are a promising material platform for the realization of our proposal.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric tunnel junctions, in which ferroelectric polarization and quantum tunneling are closely coupled to induce the tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect, have attracted considerable interest due to their potential in nonvolatile and low-power consumption memory devices. The ferroelectric size effect, however, has hindered ferroelectric tunnel junctions from exhibiting a robust TER effect. Here, our study proposes doping engineering in a two-dimensional in-plane ferroelectric semiconductor as an effective strategy to design a two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction composed of homostructural p-type semiconductor/ferroelectric/n-type semiconductor. Because the in-plane polarization persists in the monolayer ferroelectric barrier, the vertical thickness of two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction can be as thin as a monolayer. We show that the monolayer In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe junction provides an embodiment of this strategy. Combining density functional theory calculations with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we investigate the electron transport properties of In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe and reveal a giant TER effect of 1460\%. The dynamical modulation of both barrier width and barrier height during the ferroelectric switching is responsible for this giant TER effect. These findings provide an important insight into the understanding of the quantum behaviors of electrons in materials at the two-dimensional limit and enable new possibilities for next-generation nonvolatile memory devices based on flexible two-dimensional lateral ferroelectric tunnel junctions.},

  abstract = {Incorporation of two-dimensional (2D) materials in electronic devices inevitably involves contact with metals, and the nature of this contact (Ohmic and/or Schottky) can dramatically affect the electronic properties of the assembly. Controlling these properties to reliably form low-resistance Ohmic contact remains a great challenge due to the strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect at the interface. Herein, we employ density functional theory calculations to show that van der Waals stacking can significantly modulate Schottky barrier heights in the contact formed between multilayer InSe and 2D metals by suppressing the FLP effect. Importantly, the increase of InSe layer number induces a transition from Schottky to Ohmic contact, which is attributed to the decrease of the conduction band minimum and rise of the valence band maximum of InSe. Based on the computed tunneling and Schottky barriers, Cd3C2 is the most compatible electrode for 2D InSe among the materials studied. This work illustrates a straightforward method for developing more effective InSe-based 2D electronic nanodevices.},

Accompanying the paraelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition, the paraelectric phase adopting one of the 32 crystallographic point groups is broken into subgroups belonging to one of the 10 ferroelectric point groups, i.e. C1, C2, C1h, C2v, C4, C4v, C3, C3v, C6 and C6v. The symmetry breaking is captured by the order parameter known as spontaneous polarization, whose switching under an external electric field results in a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop. In addition, the responses of spontaneous polarization to other external excitations are related to a number of physical effects such as second-harmonic generation, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and dielectric properties. Based on these, this review summarizes recent developments in molecular ferroelectrics since 2011 and focuses on the relationship between symmetry breaking and ferroelectricity, offering ideas for exploring high-performance molecular ferroelectrics.},

Herein, combining first-principle band structure calculations with more precise quantum transport simulations, we systematically explore the interface properties between monolayer (ML) indium selenide (InSe) and a sequence of common electrodes in an FET. The ML InSe band structure is damaged by Sc, Au, Cr, Pt, and Pd electrodes but identifiable in contact with Ag, Cu, In, graphene and ML O-terminated Cr2C electrodes. A lateral n-type Schottky contact is generated with Sc, Au, Cr, Pt, Pd, and ML graphene electrodes owing to Fermi level pinning originating from the metal-induced gap states, which feature a pinning factor of 0.32. Luckily, a highly desirable lateral n-type Ohmic contact is generated with the Ag, Cu, and In electrodes. The calculated contact polarity is in agreement with the available experimental results using Au, Cr, ML graphene, Ag, and In as electrodes. Remarkably, a lateral p-type Schottky contact is generated with ML O-terminated Cr2C despite the very high work function of ML InSe. Therefore, this study offers a deeper understanding of ML InSe device interfaces and instructions for the design of ML InSe transistors.},

Here we use optical spectroscopy to demonstrate that electrons in a monolayer semiconductor with density lower than 3~\texttimes ~1011~per centimetre squared form a Wigner crystal. The combination of a high electron effective mass and reduced dielectric screening enables us to observe electronic charge order even in the absence of a moir\'e potential or an external magnetic field. The interactions between a resonantly injected exciton and electrons arranged in a periodic lattice modify the exciton bandstructure so that an umklapp resonance arises in the optical reflection spectrum, heralding the presence of charge order13. Our findings demonstrate that charge-tunable transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers14 enable the investigation of previously uncharted territory for many-body physics where interaction energy dominates over kinetic energy.},

This work proposes and presents a comprehensive study of a NCFET based on few-layer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 as the ferroelectric in order to reduce the sub-threshold swing through voltage amplification effect. By employing first principles electronic structure calculations, the Landau constants of mono and few-layer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 are extracted which were utilized for analyzing the characteristics of a NCFET with a monolayer MoS2 as the channel material. Sub-threshold swings in the range of 27-59 mV/dec were achieved for few-layer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 that can be further improved by increasing the thickness of the ferroelectric layer and by using a thinner or high-{$\kappa$} insulate layer.},

  abstract = {In this work, we have observed the enhancement of carrier concentration in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 at a specific S content. This enhancement results from avoiding the annihilation of defects, such as VIn and interstitial Ini acting as donors, via the rearrangement of both the cationic and anionic disorders. Therefore, there is a remarkable improvement in electrical conductivity ({$\sigma$}). For example, the sample {$\alpha$}-In2S0.05Se2.95 perpendicular to the pressing direction (C+) gives the highest {$\sigma$} value of 5.56 \texttimes{} 103 {$\Omega-$}1 m-1 at 923 K, while the virgin {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 gives only 9.17 \texttimes{} 102 {$\Omega-$}1 m-1. In addition, there are dual effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ({$\kappa$}L) resulting from the stabilization of the lattice structure caused by the rearrangement of defect disorder and the lattice distortion from the formation of defect SSe. Therefore, the lattice contribution ({$\kappa$}L) in S-incorporated {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 remains relatively high at high temperatures. As a consequence, we have improved the thermoelectric performance, achieving a ZT value of 0.67 for {$\alpha$}-In2S0.05Se2.95 at 923 K, which is about 2.8 times that of virgin {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 (ZT = 0.24 at C+).},

A number of practical algorithms to take into account dispersion interactions are tested, from empirical Grimme corrections to many-body dispersion schemes. Due to the utmost technical accuracy achieved in the calculations, nearly degenerate energy-volume curves of different polytypes are resolved, and the conclusions concerning the relative stability of competing polytypes drawn. The predictions are done as for how the equilibrium between different polytypes will be shifted under the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The band structures are inspected under the angle of identifying features specific for different polytypes and with respect to modifications of the band dispersions brought about by the use of modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) scheme for the exchange-correlation potential. As another way to improve the predictions of bandgaps values, hybrid functional calculations according to the HSE06 scheme are performed for the band structures, and the relation with the mBJ results are discussed. Both methods nicely agree with the experimental results and with state-of-the-art GW calculations. Some discrepancies are identified in cases of close competition between the direct and indirect gap (e.g., in GaSe); moreover, the accurate placement of bands revealing relatively localized states is slightly different according to mBJ and HSE06 schemes.},

Although van der Waals (vdW) contacts between two-dimensional semiconductors and metals have shown great potential, direct control of the performance of such contacts has still not been explored. Here, we predicted that vdW contacts between ferroelectric semiconductors and metals can present multifunctional performances switched by an external electric field. Based on first-principles calculations, our results shown that when the polarization direction of In2Se3 is reversed from downward to upward, the original n-type Schottky contact turned out to be the highly desirable ohmic contact in In2Se3/M3C2(M= Zn, Cd, Hg), while a transition from the p-type to n-type Schottky contact is observed in VS2 and TSe2 (T = V, Nb, Ta) metals. The calculated pinning factors suggest a weak Fermi-level pinning effect and tunable Schottky barrier height. Thus, our results show the strong effect of ferroelectric polarization on the properties of vdW contacts, which is important for designing and fabricating high-performance field-effect transistors.},

We have performed high-pressure Raman spectroscopy studies on RbHSO4 up to a maximum pressure of 5.15 GPa and at ambient temperature to understand the microscopic origin and mechanism of ferroelectric transition. On the basis of the pressure dependence of Raman mode frequencies and their full-width at half-maxima, we observed a transition around a pressure of 0.3 GPa, similar to the ferroelectric transition discovered in dielectric measurements, followed by another transition around 2.4 GPa. These phase transitions are evident from the appearance/disappearance of Raman-active modes and the change in the slope of frequencies with pressures. From the pressure dependence of the S\textendash O and S\textendash OH frequencies, we deduce that HSO4\textendash{} ion ordering results in ferroelectric phase transition around 0.3 GPa. Further, the transition around 2.4 GPa pressure is associated with significant changes in the stretching and bending vibrational frequencies and indicates a structural phase transition with possible lowering of the crystal symmetry. Interestingly, no significant changes are observed in the Raman spectrum around 1 GPa, at which a phase transition was noticed in earlier X-ray and dielectric studies.}

Polar metals, however, defy this rule and have thus attracted considerable attention as a new class of ferroelectrics exhibiting novel properties. Here, we fabricate a new polar metal film based on the typical ferroelectric material BaTiO3by combining chemical doping and epitaxial strain induced by a substrate. The temperature dependences of the c-axis lattice constant and the second harmonic generation intensity of La-doped BaTiO3films indicate the existence of polar transitions. In addition, through La doping, films become metallic at the polar phase, and metallicity enhancement at the polar state occurs in low-La-doped films. This intriguing behaviour is effectively explained by our first-principles calculations. Our demonstration suggests that the carrier doping to ferroelectric material with epitaxial strain serves as a new way to explore polar metals.},

The heterostructures, with As-facet contacting InSe, are confirmed to be preeminent photocatalyst for water splitting. While formed with Ga-facet, heterostructures can be used as appropriate photovoltaic material. All heterostructures possess broad absorption range, with high absorption coefficients ({$\sim$}105). Besides, the carrier mobilities are outstanding. Therefore, the above prediction results make the InSe/GaAs heterostructures promising to be used in solar energy utilization.},

  abstract = {Three-terminal synaptic transistors are basic units of neuromorphic computing chips, which may overcome the bottleneck of conventional von Neumann computing. So far, most of the three-terminal synaptic transistors use the dielectric layer to change the state of the channel and mimic the synaptic behavior. For this purpose, special dielectric layers are needed, such as ionic liquids, solid electrolytes, or ferroelectric insulators, which are difficult for miniaturization and integration. Here, we report a novel type of synaptic transistors using a two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductor, i.e., {$\alpha$}-In2Se3, as the channel material to mimic the synaptic behavior for the first time. The essential synaptic behaviors, such as single-spike response, paired-spike response, and multispike response have been experimentally demonstrated. Most importantly, the conventional gate dielectric material of our transistors may facilitate the miniaturization and batch manufacture of synaptic transistors. The results indicate that the three-terminal synaptic transistors based on two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductors are very promising for neuromorphic systems.},

Particularly, using electron microscopy and correlative in situ micro-Raman and electrical measurements, we show that, in contrast to bulk single crystals, the {$\beta$} phase can persist in single-crystal thin layers at room temperature (RT). The single-crystal nature of the layers before and after the phase transition allows for unambiguous determination of changes in the electrical resistivity. Specifically, the {$\beta$} phase has an electrical resistivity about 1\textendash 2 orders of magnitude lower than the {$\alpha$} phase. Furthermore, we find that the temperature of the {$\alpha$} \textrightarrow{} {$\beta$} phase transformation increases by as much as 130 K with the layer thickness decreasing from {$\sim$}87 nm to {$\sim$}4 nm. These single-crystal thin layers are ideal for studying the scaling behavior of the phase transformations and associated changes of the electrical properties. For these In2Se3 thin layers, the accessibility of the {$\beta$} phase at RT, with distinct electrical properties than the {$\alpha$} phase, provides the basis for multilevel phase-change memories in a single material system.},

BaTi2O5 is regarded as a homogeneous system, and the lattice dynamics can be interpreted by the selection rules and tensor properties of the homogeneous structure. Angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy clearly shows that an A-mode-type overdamped phonon plays the key role in the phase transition. Using a combination of experimental results and first-principles calculations, we explain the phase transition as follows: In one of three TiO6 octahedral units, Ti vibrates along the b axis opposite an oxygen octahedral unit with large damping in the paraelectric phase, whereas this vibration is frozen in the ferroelectric phase, leading to a change in the space group from nonpolar C2/m to polar C2.}

Important concepts and principles in physics and chemistry that govern the formation of the SBH are described in detail, from which the experimental and theoretical results for individual MS interfaces can be understood.

A number of superstructures of the hexagonal (or rhombohedral) room temperature phase have been discovered by means of electron diffraction. The transition at 200 \textdegree C which corresponds to the {$\alpha$} ? ? transformation is accompanied by intense non-radial diffuse scattering, which is attributed to anisotropic transverse acoustic phonons. On cooling, a one-dimensional deformation modulated structure is formed, which is interpreted as the frozen-in configuration of the predominant vibration mode, which becomes soft below the transition temperature in the range 60 to 200 \textdegree C. This transition shows a large hysteresis, which is also found in thermal expansion. A new low temperature phase, which is presumably orthorhombic, is discovered on cooling below ?125 \textdegree C. The structure of this phase can alternatively be described as being the result of pairing of indium ions or as the frozen-in configuration of a longitudinal mode. Both phases exhibit a domain structure, which in the case of the {$\alpha$}-phase can be revealed by lattice resolution. Several high temperature superstructures are observed by means of electron diffraction. A direct relationship with the ?-phase is established and in a number of cases the superperiods are directly imaged.},

In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time- and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a single-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize [``The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016,'' http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel\_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ (Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also resulted in a growing number of reports on the nearly ubiquitous presence of ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in the bulk or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric-like responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible mechanisms behind observed behaviors and possible experimental strategies for their identification.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent developments on the fabrication and control of semiconductor-based quantum dots, we theoretically study a finite system of tunnel-coupled quantum dots with the electrons interacting through the long-range Coulomb interaction. When the interelectron separation is large and the quantum dot confinement potential is weak, the system behaves as an effective Wigner crystal with a period determined by the electron average density with considerable electron hopping throughout the system. For stronger periodic confinement potentials, however, the system makes a crossover to a Mott-type ground state where the electrons are completely localized at the individual dots with little interdot tunneling. In between these two phases, the system is essentially a strongly correlated electron liquid with intersite electron hopping constrained by strong Coulomb interaction. We characterize this Wigner-Mott-liquid quantum crossover with detailed numerical finite-size diagonalization calculations of the coupled interacting quantum dot system, showing that these phases can be smoothly connected by tuning the system parameters. Experimental feasibility of observing such a hopping-tuned Wigner-Mott-liquid crossover in currently available semiconductor quantum dots is discussed. In particular, we connect our theoretical results to recent quantum-dot-based quantum emulation experiments where a collective Coulomb blockade was demonstrated. We discuss realistic disorder effects on our theoretical findings. One conclusion of our work is that experiments must explore lower density quantum dot arrays in order to clearly observe the Wigner phase although the Mott-liquid crossover phenomenon should already manifest itself in the currently available quantum dot arrays. We also suggest a direct experimental electron density probe, such as atomic force microscopy or scanning tunneling microscopy, for a clear observation of the effective Wigner crystal phase.}

However, reaching the thin film limit in conventional ferroelectrics is a long-standing challenge due to the presence of the critical thickness effect. van der Waals materials, thanks to their stable layered structure, saturated interfacial bonding and weak interlayer couplings, are promising for exploring ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics and device applications. Here, we demonstrate a switchable room-temperature ferroelectric diode built upon a 2D ferroelectric {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 layer as thin as 5 nm in the form of a graphene/{$\alpha$}-In2Se3 heterojunction. The intrinsic out-of-plane ferroelectricity of the {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 thin layers is evidenced by the observation of reversible spontaneous electric polarization with a relatively low coercive electric field of {$\sim$}2 \texttimes{} 105 V cm-1 and a typical ferroelectric domain size of around tens {$\mu$}m2. Owing to the out-of-plane ferroelectricity of the {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 layer, the Schottky barrier at the graphene/{$\alpha$}-In2Se3 interface can be effectively tuned by switching the electric polarization with an applied voltage, leading to a pronounced switchable double diode effect with an on/off ratio of {$\sim$}105. Our results offer a new way for developing novel nanoelectronic devices based on 2D ferroelectrics.},

  abstract = {Abstract High-density memory is integral in solid-state electronics. 2D ferroelectrics offer a new platform for developing ultrathin electronic devices with nonvolatile functionality. Recent experiments on layered {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 confirm its room-temperature out-of-plane ferroelectricity under ambient conditions. Here, a nonvolatile memory effect in a hybrid 2D ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) made of ultrathin {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 and graphene is demonstrated. The resistance of the graphene channel in the FeFET is effectively controllable and retentive due to the electrostatic doping, which stems from the electric polarization of the ferroelectric {$\alpha$}-In2Se3. The electronic logic bit can be represented and stored with different orientations of electric dipoles in the top-gate ferroelectric. The 2D FeFET can be randomly rewritten over more than 105 cycles without losing the nonvolatility. The approach demonstrates a prototype of rewritable nonvolatile memory with ferroelectricity in van der Waals 2D materials.},

Our results suggest that these significantly improved thermoelectric properties are not due to the 2D quantum confinement effects but instead are a consequence of the Schottky barrier at the junction interface, which leads to hot carrier transport and shifts the balance between thermally and field-driven currents. This ``bulk'' effect extends the advantages of van der Waals materials beyond the few-layer limit. Adopting such an approach of using energy barriers between van der Waals materials, where the interface states are minimal, is expected to enhance the thermoelectric performance in other 2D materials as well.},

In addition to trapping and release of charges, other scattering mechanisms that influence mobility are considered along with screening by free carriers. The mobility for each of the dominant scattering mechanisms is calculated using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in the relaxation time approximation. It is found that trapped carriers very effectively scatter the charges that move in extended states. This type of scattering is unique to TFTs. Experimental data from high-mobility amorphous metal oxide TFTs are compared with calculations with very good agreement. At high temperatures, scattering by longitudinal optical phonons and surface phonons becomes significant. This work represents the first successful combination of charge carrier scattering and the BTE with thermally activated MTR transport in a disordered semiconductor. Charge transport in amorphous metal oxide transistors is quantitatively described for the first time and the factors that influence the mobility at various temperatures and charge carrier densities are clearly described. This approach can be used for describing transport in several amorphous and polycrystalline semiconductors with significant disorder and trapping.},

To understand the underlying mechanism, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of In2Se3 ultrathin films ranging from 11 nm to 40 nm on mica and Au substrates, respectively, analogous to the practical layout of a photodetector. Our results show that the carrier lifetime of {$\alpha$}-phase In2Se3 on mica is nearly independent of thickness and comparable to that of MoS2, and the efficient charge carrier separation occurs on Au substrate. Because all of the key parameters of In2Se3 nanoflakes that determine its photoresponsive behavior are of similar values to those of MoS2, we suggest that the interface effect, i.e. photogating effect and contact resistance, should be responsible for the dramatic photoresponsivity reported for field-effect transistor-type optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {In most thin-film transistors, the concept of mobility edge needs to be redefined to take into account important constraints. We describe how the mobility edge concept has to be reinterpreted when applied to thin-film transistors. Charge carriers can be significantly localized due to strong scattering, altering the model of band transport in extended states so that, effectively, only a fraction of carriers can actually move in the extended states, in accordance with a statistical distribution of free paths. It is necessary to explicitly consider this effect in applying conventional semiconductor transport theories based on solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). We are then able to apply the BTE with appropriate scattering mechanisms and obtain results that agree well with experiment for the case of a polymer thin-film transistor (TFT). This approach is very well suited to thin-film transistors based on polymer and organic semiconductors, and also many amorphous oxide semiconductors with room temperature mobilities in the range 1\textendash 20 cm2/(Vs).}

However, the observed insensitivity of the location of the memory window with respect to temperature cannot be explained by the current understanding of the device physics of FeFETs. Such temperature dependent studies of scaled FeFETs can lead to useful insights into their underlying device physics, while providing an assessment of the potential of this emerging technology for cryogenic memory applications.}

Fulfilling their potential requires achieving the interplay between ferroelectricity and electronic characteristics on the device operation level, which is currently lacking since most studies are focused on the verification of ferroelectricity from different 2D materials. Here, by leveraging the ferroelectricity and semiconducting properties of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3, ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeSFETs) are fabricated and their potential as artificial synapses is demonstrated. Multiple conductance states can be induced in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3-based FeSFETs by controlling the out-of-plane polarization, which enables the device to faithfully mimic biosynaptic behaviors. In comparison with charge-trapping-based three-terminal synaptic devices, the electronic synapses based on {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 have the advantages of good controllability, fast learning, and easy integration of gate dielectric, rendering them promising for neuromorphic computing. In addition, an abnormal resistive switching phenomenon in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 is reported when operated in the in-plane ferroelectric switching mode. The findings pave the way forward for {$\alpha$}-In2Se3-based FeSFETs for developing neuromorphic devices in brain-inspired intelligent systems.},

Based on this structure, high performance photodetectors have been achieved with a broad photoresponse spectrum (visible to 1550 nm) and quick response (200 {$\mu$}s). Most importantly, with the intrinsic huge electric field derived from the polarization of ferroelectric polymer (P(VDF-TrFE)) gating, a low dark current of the photodetector can be achieved without additional gate bias.

In addition, ferroelectricity can be much more robust than ferromagnetism in 2D. In this study, we review the studies on 2D ferroelectricity starting from 2013, which are mainly first-principles predictions, including functionalization-induced 2D ferroelectricity in prevalent non-polar 2D materials as well as 2D intrinsic ferroelectricity, which are either in-plane or vertical. Although the number of reports on 2D ferroelectricity is still small compared to the large amount of research on 2D ferromagnetism, the potential of these materials to unravel new science and technology has stimulated considerable interest in 2D ferroelectricity, making it a fast developing field. It is interesting to note that 2D ferroelectricity was experimentally realized a year before 2D ferromagnetism, and the large difference in the Curie temperatures of these materials has further demonstrated that 2D ferroelectricity could be much more robust than 2D ferromagnetism.

Here we report the experimental discovery of the locking between out-of-plane dipoles and in-plane lattice asymmetry in atomically thin In2Se3 crystals, a new stabilization mechanism leading to our observation of intrinsic 2D out-of-plane ferroelectricity. Through second harmonic generation spectroscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy, we found switching of out-of-plane electric polarization requires a flip of nonlinear optical polarization that corresponds to the inversion of in-plane lattice orientation. The polar order shows a very high transition temperature ({$\sim$}700 K) without the assistance of extrinsic screening. This finding of intrinsic 2D ferroelectricity resulting from dipole locking opens up possibilities to explore 2D multiferroic physics and develop ultrahigh density memory devices.},

Current experimental trial-and-error methods face the fundamental challenges of low efficiency and a lack of clear guidelines. In contrast, based on state-of-the-art first-principles calculations and well-developed structural prediction algorithms, computational simulations can not only predict an increasing number of new 2D materials with desirable properties but also suggest their possible synthesis routes. Among them, many predictions, such as the growth of monolayer boron sheets (borophene), piezoelectricity in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), ferroelectricity in tin telluride (SnTe), topological defects in transition metal dichalcogenides, Dirac cones in borophene, and high carrier mobility and mobility anisotropy in black phosphorene, have been verified by experiments, showing the accuracy of computational approaches, as well as their power in facilitating experimental exploration in 2D flatland. To date, the rapid expansion in theoretical work has generated a large number of very important results, but the overall picture of recent progress, current challenges, and future opportunities is rarely discussed. Accordingly, this review aims at providing information about current trends and future perspectives for 2D materials research. To achieve this, the review is organized as follows: (1) discussion of structural predictions in 2D materials using borophene as an example; (2) predictions of the electronic, optical, mechanical, and magnetic properties in various 2D materials; (3) discussion of the influence of defects on the structures and properties of 2D materials; and (4) evaluation of current progress in computational simulations and perspectives for future development.},

Over the past few decades, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been developed as a powerful platform, which enables in situ characterization of topological structures, local physical properties, and even manipulating samples at nanometer scale. Currently, an imaging mode called PeakForce Tapping (PFT) has attracted more and more attention due to its advantages of nondestructive characterization, high-resolution imaging, and concurrent quantitative property mapping. In this review, the origin, principle, and advantages of PFT on nanoscience are introduced in detail. Three typical applications of this technique, including high-resolution imaging of soft samples in liquid environment, quantitative nanomechanical property mapping, and electrical/electrochemical property measurement will be reviewed comprehensively.

As the origin of several extraordinary mechanical behaviors, ferroelasticity has also been predicted theoretically in 2D materials, but so far lacks experimental validation and investigation. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of 2D ferroelasticity in both exfoliated and chemical-vapor-deposited {$\beta$}'-In2Se3 down to few-layer thickness. We identify quantitatively 2D spontaneous strain originating from in-plane antiferroelectric distortion, using both atomic-resolution electron microscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction. The symmetry-equivalent strain orientations give rise to three domain variants separated by 60\textdegree{} and 120\textdegree{} domain walls (DWs). Mechanical switching between these ferroelastic domains is achieved under {$\leq$}0.5\% external strain, demonstrating the feasibility to tailor the antiferroelectric polar structure as well as DW patterns through mechanical stimuli. The detailed domain switching mechanism through both DW propagation and domain nucleation is unraveled, and the effects of 3D stacking on such 2D ferroelasticity are also discussed. The observed 2D ferroelasticity here should be widely available in 2D materials with anisotropic lattice distortion, including the 1T' transition metal dichalcogenides with Peierls distortion and 2D ferroelectrics such as the SnTe family, rendering tantalizing potential to tune 2D functionalities through strain or DW engineering.},

Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin semiconductors, such as monolayer h-BN and MoS2 with their atom-level geometry, are currently emerging as new and attractive members of the piezoelectric family. However, their piezoelectric polarization is commonly limited to the in-plane direction of odd-number ultrathin layers, largely restricting their application in integrated nanoelectromechanical systems. Recently, theoretical calculations have predicted the existence of out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectricity in monolayer {$\alpha$}-In2Se3. Here, we experimentally report the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectricity in monolayer to bulk {$\alpha$}-In2Se3, attributed to their noncentrosymmetry originating from the hexagonal stacking. Specifically, the corresponding d33 piezoelectric coefficient of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 increases from 0.34 pm/V (monolayer) to 5.6 pm/V (bulk) without any odd\textendash even effect. In addition, we also demonstrate a type of {$\alpha$}-In2Se3-based flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator as an energy-harvesting cell and electronic skin. The out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectricity in {$\alpha$}-In2Se3 flakes offers an opportunity to enable both directional and nondirectional piezoelectric devices to be applicable for self-powered systems and adaptive and strain-tunable electronics/optoelectronics.},

As one of the typical III\textendash VI semiconductors, InSe has attracted much attention due to its outstanding electrical transport property, attractive quantum physics characteristics, and dramatic photoresponse when it is reduced to atomic scale. However, scalable synthesis of single phase 2D InSe has not yet been achieved so far, greatly hindering further fundamental studies and device applications. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of wafer-scale layered InSe nanosheets by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The obtained InSe layers exhibit good uniformity, high crystallinity with macro texture feature, and stoichiometric growth by in situ precise control. The characterization of optical properties indicates that PLD grown InSe nanosheets have a wide range tunable band gap (1.26\textendash 2.20 eV) among the large-scale 2D crystals. The device demonstration of field-effect transistor shows the n-type channel feature with high mobility of 10 cm2 V\textendash 1 s\textendash 1. Upon illumination, InSe-based phototransistors show a broad photoresponse to the wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The maximum photoresponsivity attains 27 A/W, plus a response time of 0.5 s for the rise and 1.7 s for the decay, demonstrating the strong and fast photodetection ability. Our findings suggest that the PLD grown InSe would be a promising choice for future device applications in the 2D limit.},

  abstract = {2D semiconductor materials are promising channel materials in the next generation of field-effect transistors (FETs). Recently, 2D In2Se3 has been fabricated and predicted to present planar direction-dependent electrical properties. Herein, ab initio quantum transport simulations are used to explore the interfacial properties between monolayer (ML) In2Se3 and a series of common metal electrodes in a FET. By reversing the planar direction of ML In2Se3, different lateral interfacial properties are obtained: A highly desirable n-type ohmic contact is shaped between Au and up-directed ML In2Se3; however, a p-type Schottky contact appears when the direction is switched. In addition, Ag can generate desirable lateral n-type ohmic contact with both the directions of ML In2Se3. A reversion from n- to p-type lateral Schottky contact occurs in both In and Sc when the direction switches from up to down. Down-directed ML In2Se3 is dynamically unstable with the Pt and transforms into up-direction to form a p-type ohmic contact. The average pinning factor is 0.12 and 0.09 for up-and down-directed ML In2Se3, respectively, implying a strong Fermi-level pinning. Therefore, the planar direction-dependent interfacial properties of ML In2Se3?metal contacts are understood deeply, which can be exploited for the ML In2Se3 FET devices.},

Here, we report the realization of robust trap effect, which can capture carriers and store them steadily, in two-dimensional MoS2xSe2(1-x) via synergistic effect of sulphur vacancies and isoelectronic selenium atoms. As a result, infrared detection with very high photoresponsivity (2.4\,\texttimes\,105\,A\,W-1) and photoswitching ratio (\textasciitilde 108), as well as nonvolatile infrared memory with high program/erase ratio (\textasciitilde 108) and fast switching time, are achieved just based on an individual flake.

The 2D features, sizable bandgaps and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization and device fabrication of the representative MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 TMDs make TMDs very attractive in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Similar to graphite and graphene, the atoms within each layer in 2D TMDs are joined together by covalent bonds, while van der Waals interactions keep the layers together. This makes the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs layer-dependent. In this review, we discuss the basic lattice vibrations of 2D TMDs from monolayer, multilayer to bulk material, including high-frequency optical phonons, interlayer shear and layer breathing phonons, the Raman selection rule, layer-number evolution of phonons, multiple phonon replica and phonons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The extensive capabilities of Raman spectroscopy in investigating the properties of TMDs are discussed, such as interlayer coupling, spin\textendash orbit splitting and external perturbations. The interlayer vibrational modes are used in rapid and substrate-free characterization of the layer number of multilayer TMDs and in probing interface coupling in TMD heterostructures.

The kinetics of the reversible thermally driven {$\beta$}-to-{$\beta{'}$} phase transformation was investigated by temperature-dependent transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, corroborated with the expected minimum-energy pathways obtained from our first-principles calculations. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal in-plane ferroelectricity in the {$\beta{'}$} phase. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show that the indirect bandgap of monolayer {$\beta{'}$} In2Se3 is 2.50 eV, which is larger than that of the multilayer form with a measured value of 2.05 eV. Our results on the reversible thermally driven phase transformation in 2D In2Se3 with thickness down to the monolayer limit and the associated electronic properties will provide insights to tune the functionalities of 2D In2Se3 and other emerging 2D ferroelectric materials and shed light on their numerous potential applications (e.g., nonvolatile memory devices).},

  abstract = {Atomically thin indium selenide (InSe) is a representative two-dimensional (2D) family that have recently attracted extensive interest for their intriguing emerging physics and potential optoelectronic applications with high-performance. Here, by utilizing molecular beam epitaxy and scanning tunneling microscopy, we report a controlled synthesis of InSe thin films down to the monolayer limit and characterization of their electronic properties at atomic scale. Highly versatile growth conditions are developed to fabricate well crystalline InSe films, with a reversible and controllable phase transformation between InSe and In2Se3. The band gap size of InSe films, as enhanced by quantum confinement, increases with decreasing film thickness. Near various categories of lattice imperfections, the band gap becomes significantly enlarged, resulting in a type-I band alignments for lateral heterojunctions. Such band gap enhancement, as unveiled from our first-principles calculations, is ascribed to the local compressive strain imposed by the lattice imperfections. Moreover, InSe films host highly conductive 2D electron gas, manifesting prominent quasiparticle scattering signatures. The 2D electron gas is self-formed via substrate doping of electrons, which shift the Fermi level above the confinement-quantized conduction band. Our study identifies InSe ultrathin film as an appealing system for both fundamental research and potential applications in nanoelectrics and optoelectronics.},

In the case of thin InSe deposited on a transparent substrate, the transmittance of the flake in the blue region of the visible spectrum can be used to estimate the thickness. For InSe supported by SiO2/Si, the thickness of the flakes can be estimated either by assessing their apparent colors or accurately analyzed using a Fresnel-law based fitting model of the optical contrast spectra. Finally, we also studied the thickness dependency of the InSe photoluminescence emission energy, which provides an additional tool to estimate the InSe thickness and it works both for InSe deposited on SiO2/Si and on a transparent polymeric substrate.

Significant features of the InSe device are the thickness dependent bandgap modification resulting in a peak shift of photoluminescence and a drastic variation of electron mobility. In this study, by applying the pulsed-laser deposition technique, we investigated the optical and electrical properties of c-axis oriented InSe films with the thickness varying from a few to hundred nanometers. The energy at the absorption edge systematically shifts from about 3.3 to 1.4\,eV with the increasing thickness. The InSe films on Al2O3(0001) are highly resistive, while those on InP(111) are conductive, which probably originates from the valence mismatch effect at the interface. The electron mobility of the conducting charge carrier at the interface of InSe/InP is enhanced in thicker samples than the critical thickness of about 10\,nm, corresponding to the bandgap modification characterized by the optical measurement. Therefore, the substrate and the film thickness are critically important factors for the materialization of InSe optical and electrical device applications.},

We report the discovery of in-plane ferroelectricity in a widely investigated vdW layered material, {$\beta{'}$}-In2Se3. The in-plane ferroelectricity is strongly tied to the formation of one-dimensional superstructures aligning along one of the threefold rotational symmetric directions of the hexagonal lattice in the c plane. Surprisingly, the superstructures and ferroelectricity are stable to 200\textdegree C in both bulk and thin exfoliated layers of In2Se3. Because of the in-plane nature of ferroelectricity, the domains exhibit a strong linear dichroism, enabling novel polarization-dependent optical properties.

As compared to the BFO film with random orientations, the BFO film with a strong preferred orientation exhibits larger photovoltaic output as a result of its larger spontaneous polarization in the unpoled state. We further demonstrate that there is remarkable influence of external electric field poling on the photovoltage in the two polycrystalline BFO films, and the larger net change of the photovoltage after positive and negative poling in the highly preferred oriented BFO film is believed to be due to its improved crystalline structure. Our experiment results indicate that the responsiveness to external electric field and photovoltaic performance of the narrow-band-gap BFO film can be optimized by structural modification, making it possible to apply in the photosensitive and other optoelectronic devices.},

In this work, by using the first-principles calculations, we investigate the ferroelectric and dipole control of electronic structures of the 2D ferroelectric heterostructure InTe/In2Se3. It is found that band alignment is closely dependent on the ferroelectric polarization of In2Se3. By switching the polarization of In2Se3, the band alignment of InTe/In2Se3 switches from a staggered (type II) to a straddling type (type I), and the band gap changes from indirect gap 0.76 eV to direct gap 0.15 eV. When the ferroelectric field of In2Se3 is reversed, the band alignment of InTe/In2Se3 switches from type-I to type-II, and the band gap changes from indirect gap 0.76 eV to direct gap 0.15 eV. In addition, we find that the interlayer dipole can also effectively modulate the band structure and induce the type-I to type-II band alignment transition. Our present results indicate that the 2D ferroelectric heterostructure with the tunable band alignment and band gap can be of great significance in the optoelectronic devices.},

The two seemingly mutually exclusive phenomena become strongly intertwined at the nanoscale in electrochemically active materials. However, the intrinsic coupling between ferroelectric switching and ionic activities in bulk crystalline materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we report anomalous polarization switching characteristics of a van der Waals (vdW) layered ferroelectric ionic conductor, CuInP2S6. By synergistic polarization switching and dielectric spectroscopy studies in both temperature and frequency domains, we reveal that the polarization switching kinetics of this compound is ionic-conduction-limited, due to the strong electrostatic interaction between ferroelectric and ionic defect dipoles. The crucial role of thermally-activated displacive instability of Cu ions is confirmed by the single-crystal X-ray crystallography results. The findings provide fundamental insight into the ionic kinetics under an electric field in crystals with coexisting dipole order (ferroelectricity) and disorder (ionic defect and conductivity). Last but not least, we demonstrate that the spontaneous ionic defect-polarization interlock can lead to permanent ferroelectric retention, which is essential for information storage.},

In particular, they exhibit rich and highly tunable electronic properties, with a bandgap that spans from semi-metallic up to 2 eV depending on the crystal phase, material composition, number of layers and even external stimulus. This paper provides an overview of the electronic devices and circuits based on 2D TMDs, such as Esaki diodes, resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs), logic and RF transistors, tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs), static random access memories (SRAMs), dynamic RAM (DRAMs), flash memory, ferroelectric memories, resistitive memories and phase-change memories. We address the basic device principles, the advantages and limitations of these 2D electronic devices, and our perspectives on future developments.},
